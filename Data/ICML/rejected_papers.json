{"abstract":"This paper introduces Topo-Miner, a novel computational platform for rapid and accurate topological feature extraction based on a CRISPR-enhanced DNA computer.  Addressing the growing importance of topological data analysis (TDA) in understanding complex systems and the computational bottlenecks of traditional TDA methods, Topo-Miner leverages the inherent parallelism of DNA computing and the sequence specificity of CRISPR-Cas gene editing technology to drastically accelerate persistent homology calculations, a core algorithm in TDA.  We detail the design and implementation of Topo-Miner, including the encoding of nodes, edges, and simplices into DNA sequences and the use of CRISPR-Cas systems (Cas9, dCas9, Cas12a) to perform boundary operations and matrix reductions in a highly parallel fashion.  Our approach extends beyond standard persistent homology by incorporating tensor-based algorithms for efficient computation of higher-order and multi-scale topological features, and we explore the potential to calculate string theory-inspired topological invariants.  Through rigorous simulations, calibrated with experimental parameters from existing literature on CRISPR-Cas systems and DNA computing, we demonstrate that Topo-Miner achieves significant speedups (50x-200x) over state-of-the-art tools like Ripser for graphs with over 10,000 nodes while maintaining high accuracy (error rates below 5% and accuracy exceeding 95%).  Furthermore, we provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the time\/space complexity and accuracy of Topo-Miner, including a mathematical proof for a lower bound on its accuracy.  We also outline a clear experimental plan for in vitro validation of Topo-Miner's capabilities.  The integration of Topo-Miner with the broader TopoComp platform, encompassing modules for graph neural network enhancement (STING) and NP-hard problem solving (TopoPath), further expands its capabilities, offering a powerful new toolkit for machine learning, particularly in graph analysis, materials science, and biological network analysis. Topo-Miner represents a paradigm shift in TDA, opening new avenues for exploring complex data and potentially enabling breakthroughs in topology-aware computing.","keywords":["topological data analysis (tda)","dna computing","crispr","persistent homology","tensor computation","topological abstraction","bio-topo-miner","computational acceleration","accuracy","scalability","heterogeneous computing","graph neural networks","optimization","artificial general intelligence (agi)","real-time  analysis"]}
