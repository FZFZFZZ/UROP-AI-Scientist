In this work, we present the first comprehensive study on the capabilities of pretrained LLMs to infer personal attributes from text.

As people increasingly interact with LLM-powered chatbots across all aspects of life, we also explore the emerging threat of privacy-invasive chatbots trying to extract personal information through seemingly benign questions. Finally, we show that common mitigations, i.e., text anonymization and model alignment, are currently ineffective at protecting user privacy against LLM inference.

Unfortunately, NN-based models need re-training on all accumulated data at every interaction step to achieve FTL, which is computationally expensive for lifelong agents. In this paper, we revisit models that can achieve FTL with incremental updates. Specifically, our world model is a linear regression model supported by nonlinear random features. The linear part ensures efficient FTL update while the nonlinear random feature empowers the fitting of complex environments. To best trade off model capacity and computation efficiency, we introduce a locality sensitive sparse encoding, which allows us to conduct efficient sparse updates even with very high dimensional nonlinear features. We validate the representation power of our encoding and verify that it allows efficient online learning under data covariate shift.

In this work, we address this oversight by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Our theoretical findings demonstrate that when the target value is conditioned on both the input set and subset, it is essential to incorporate an invariant sufficient statistic of the superset into the subset of interest for effective learning. This ensures that the output value remains invariant to permutations of the subset and its corresponding superset, enabling identification of the specific superset from which the subset originated. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective information aggregation module designed to merge the representations of subsets and supersets from a permutation invariance perspective.

Specifically, we harness well-established word embeddings to bridge two modality embedding spaces. The visual and text representations are simultaneously assigned to a set of word embeddings within pretrained LLMs by formulating the assigning procedure as an optimal transport problem. We predict the assignment of one modality from the representation of another modality data, enforcing consistent assignments for paired multimodal data. This allows vision and language representations to contain the same information, grounding the frozen LLMs' word embedding space in visual data. Moreover, a robust semantic taxonomy of LLMs can be preserved with visual data since the LLMs interpret and reason linguistic information from correlations between word embeddings. Experimental results show that VLAP achieves substantial improvements over the previous linear transformation-based approaches across a range of vision-language tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval.

To tackle these challenges, the proposed method incorporates a contrastive learning module to disentangle trivial and causal relationships, and a dynamic correlating module to disentangle dynamic and static causal relationships, respectively.

Our findings reveal that finetuning results in significant shifts in the language model's topic and style priors, while actual knowledge learning only contributes to a small fraction of the total probability change. Analysis shows that the adaptation of topic and style priors behave akin to learning simple features: they are learned rapidly and require little model capacity.

On the one hand, unlike the existing TTA paradigm that mainly repurposes the normalization layers, READ employs a new paradigm that modulates the attention between modalities in a self-adaptive way, supporting reliable fusion against reliability bias. On the other hand, READ adopts a novel objective function for robust multi-modal adaptation, where the contributions of confident predictions could be amplified and the negative impacts of noisy predictions could be mitigated. Moreover, we introduce two new benchmarks to facilitate comprehensive evaluations of multi-modal TTA under reliability bias. Extensive experiments on the benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against multi-modal reliability bias. The code and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2024-ICLR-READ.\", \"keywords\": [\"test-time adaption\", \"imbalanced multi-modal learning\"]}"}]}}

There is a pressing need to scale training of GNNs on large datasets to enable their usage on low-resource environments. Graph distillation is an effort in that direction with the aim to construct a smaller synthetic training set from the original training data without significantly compromising model performance. While initial efforts are promising, this work is motivated by two key observations: (1) Existing graph distillation algorithms themselves rely on training with the full dataset, which undermines the very premise of graph distillation. (2) The distillation process is specific to the target GNN architecture and hyper-parameters and thus not robust to changes in the modeling pipeline. We circumvent these limitations by designing a distillation algorithm called MIRAGE for graph classification. MIRAGE is built on the insight that a message-passing GNN decomposes the input graph into a multiset of computation trees. Furthermore, the frequency distribution of computation trees is often skewed in nature, enabling us to condense this data into a concise distilled summary. By compressing the computation data itself, as opposed to emulating gradient flows on the original training set—a prevalent approach to date—MIRAGE transforms into an unsupervised and architecture-agnostic distillation algorithm. Extensive benchmarking on real-world datasets underscores MIRAGE’s superiority, showcasing enhanced generalization accuracy, data compression, and distillation efficiency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.\", \"keywords\": [\"graph distillation\", \"graph classification\", \"frequent pattern mining\"]}"}]}}

First, learned watermarks could be used to build open models that naturally generate watermarked text, enabling watermarking for open models, where users can control the decoding procedure. Second, if watermarking is used to determine the provenance of generated text, an adversary can hurt the reputation of a victim model by spoofing its watermark and generating damaging watermarked text. To investigate the learnability of watermarks, we propose watermark distillation, which trains a student model to behave like a teacher model that uses decoding-based watermarking. We test our approach on three decoding-based watermarking strategies and various hyperparameter settings, finding that models can learn to generate watermarked text with high detectability.

In this study, we reveal the presence of multilingual jailbreak challenges within LLMs and consider two potential risky scenarios: unintentional and intentional. The unintentional scenario involves users querying LLMs using non-English prompts and inadvertently bypassing the safety mechanisms, while the intentional scenario concerns malicious users combining malicious instructions with multilingual prompts to deliberately attack LLMs. The experimental results reveal that in the unintentional scenario, the rate of unsafe content increases as the availability of languages decreases. Specifically, low-resource languages exhibit about three times the likelihood of encountering harmful content compared to high-resource languages, with both ChatGPT and GPT-4. In the intentional scenario, multilingual prompts can exacerbate the negative impact of malicious instructions, with astonishingly high rates of unsafe output: 80.92\\\\% for ChatGPT and 40.71\\\\% for GPT-4. To handle such a challenge in the multilingual context, we propose a novel \\\\textsc{Self-Defense} framework that automatically generates multilingual training data for safety fine-tuning.

A stable GNN will map similar graphs to close graph representations in the vectorial space, and the stability of GNNs is critical to generalize their performance to unseen graphs.

In many popular graph benchmark datasets, graph canonization successfully enhances GNNs and provides highly competitive performance, indicating the capability and great potential of proposed method in general graph representation learning.

We introduce a method for conditioning the diffusion probabilistic models on protein dynamics, specifically on the lowest non-trivial normal mode of oscillation. Our method, similar to the classifier guidance conditioning, formulates the sampling process as being driven by conditional and unconditional terms.

Grounded in this perspective, we introduce Partitioning Message Passing (PMP), an intuitive yet effective message passing paradigm expressly crafted for GFD.

By this means, the center node can adaptively adjust the information aggregated from its heterophilic and homophilic neighbors, thus avoiding the model gradient being dominated by benign nodes which occupy the majority of the population. We theoretically establish a connection between the spatial formulation of PMP and spectral analysis to characterize that PMP operates an adaptive node-specific spectral graph filter, which demonstrates the capability of PMP to handle heterophily-homophily mixed graphs.

In addition, we propose a novel adaptive causal balancing method during the alternating update between unbiased evaluation and training of the prediction model.

However, it remains unclear whether these insights generalize across the hierarchy of the human visual system, and particularly to object representations in high-level occipitotemporal cortex (OTC). To gain new empirical clarity, here we develop a family of object recognition models with parametrically varying dropout proportion $p$, which induces systematically varying dimensionality of internal responses (while controlling all other inductive biases). We find that increasing dropout produces an increasingly smooth, low-dimensional representational space. Optimal robustness to lesioning is observed at around 70% dropout, after which both accuracy and robustness decline. Representational comparison to large-scale 7T fMRI data from occipitotemporal cortex in the Natural Scenes Dataset reveals that this optimal degree of dropout is also associated with maximal emergent neural predictivity. Finally, using new techniques for achieving denoised estimates of the eigenspectrum of human fMRI responses, we compare the rate of eigenspectrum decay between model and brain feature spaces. We observe that the match between model and brain representations is associated with a common balance between efficiency and robustness in the representational space.

Our dataset comprises 400k visual\\ninstructions generated by GPT4, covering 16 vision-and-language tasks with open-ended instructions and answers. Unlike existing studies that primarily focus on positive instruction samples, we design LRV-Instruction to include both positive and negative instructions for more robust visual instruction tuning. Our negative instructions are designed at three semantic levels: (i) Nonexistent Object Manipulation, (ii) Existent Object Manipulation and (iii) Knowledge Manipulation. To efficiently measure the hallucination generated by LMMs, we propose GPT4-Assisted Visual Instruction Evaluation (GAVIE), a stable approach to evaluate visual instruction tuning like human experts. GAVIE does not require human-annotated groundtruth answers and can adapt to diverse instruction formats. We conduct comprehensive experiments to investigate the hallucination of LMMs. Our results demonstrate existing LMMs exhibit significant hallucinations when presented with our negative instructions, particularly Existent Object and Knowledge Manipulation instructions. Moreover, we successfully mitigate hallucination by finetuning MiniGPT4 and mPLUG-Owl on LRV-Instruction while improving performance on several public\\ndatasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Recently, stylized meta-learning-like ICL setups have been devised that train transformers on sequences of input-output pairs $(x, f(x))$. The function $f$ comes from a function class and generalization is checked by evaluating on sequences generated from unseen functions from the same class. One of the main discoveries in this line of research has been that for several function classes, such as linear regression, transformers successfully generalize to new functions in the class. However, the inductive biases of these models resulting in this behavior are not clearly understood. A model with unlimited training data and compute is a Bayesian predictor: it learns the pretraining distribution.\\nIn this paper we empirically examine how far this Bayesian perspective can help us understand ICL. To this end, we generalize the previous meta-ICL setup to hierarchical meta-ICL setup which involve unions of multiple task families. We instantiate this setup on a diverse range of linear and nonlinear function families and find that transformers can do ICL in this setting as well. Where Bayesian inference is tractable, we find evidence that high-capacity transformers mimic the Bayesian predictor. The Bayesian perspective provides insights into the inductive bias of ICL and how transformers perform a particular task when they are trained on multiple tasks. We also find that transformers can learn to generalize to new function classes that were not seen during pretraining. This involves deviation from the Bayesian predictor. We examine these deviations in more depth offering new insights and hypotheses.\", \"keywords\": [\"in-context learning\", \"transformers\", \"inductive biases\", \"meta learning\", \"language modelling\", \"bayesian inference\"]}"}]}}

In this work, we propose a novel technique, Chain of Hindsight, that is easy to optimize and can learn from any form of feedback, regardless of its polarity.

Our SUFO analyses reveal that: (1) while PubMedBERT, the domain-specific model, contains valuable information for fine-tuning, it can overfit to minority classes when class imbalances exist. In contrast, mixed-domain models exhibit greater resistance to overfitting, suggesting potential improvements in domain-specific model robustness; (2) in-domain pre-training accelerates feature disambiguation during fine-tuning; and (3) feature spaces undergo significant sparsification during this process, enabling clinicians to identify common outlier modes among fine-tuned models as demonstrated in this paper. These findings showcase the utility of SUFO in enhancing trust and safety when using transformers in medicine, and we believe SUFO can aid practitioners in evaluating fine-tuned language models (LMs) for other applications in medicine and in more critical domains.\", \"keywords\": [\"fine-tuning\", \"transformer-based language models\", \"feature analysis\", \"interpretation\", \"clinical classification\"]}"}]}}

We address this question empirically in synthetic, controlled settings where we can use mechanistic interpretability tools (e.g., network pruning and probing) to understand how the model's underlying capabilities are changing. We perform an extensive analysis of the effects of fine-tuning in these settings, and show that: (i) fine-tuning rarely alters the underlying model capabilities; (ii) a minimal transformation, which we call a `wrapper', is typically learned on top of the underlying model capabilities, creating the illusion that they have been modified; and (iii) further fine-tuning on a task where such ``wrapped capabilities'' are relevant leads to sample-efficient revival of the capability, i.e., the model begins reusing these capabilities after only a few gradient steps.

Recent efforts have focused on enhancing these pipelines with language models (LMs), which typically demand intricate designs and substantial computational resources. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs) such as GPT or Llama2, which demonstrate an ability to reason and to utilize general knowledge, there is a growing need for techniques which combine the textual modelling abilities of LLMs with the structural learning capabilities of GNNs. Hence, in this work, we focus on leveraging LLMs to capture textual information as features, which can be used to boost GNN performance on downstream tasks. A key innovation is our use of \\\\emph{explanations as features}: we prompt an LLM to perform zero-shot classification, request textual explanations for its decision-making process, and design an \\\\emph{LLM-to-LM interpreter} to translate these explanations into informative features for downstream GNNs.

These require strategic exploration algorithms that use relatively limited function classes for representing the policy or value function. Our goal is to explain why deep RL algorithms often perform well in practice, despite using random exploration and much more expressive function classes like neural networks. Our work arrives at an explanation by showing that many stochastic MDPs can be solved by performing only a few steps of value iteration on the random policy’s Q function and then acting greedily. When this is true, we find that it is possible to separate the exploration and learning components of RL, making it much easier to analyze. We introduce a new RL algorithm, SQIRL, that iteratively learns a near-optimal policy by exploring randomly to collect rollouts and then performing a limited number of steps of fitted-Q iteration over those roll- outs. We find that any regression algorithm that satisfies basic in-distribution generalization properties can be used in SQIRL to efficiently solve common MDPs. This can explain why deep RL works with complex function approximators like neural networks, since it is empirically established that neural networks generalize well in-distribution. Furthermore, SQIRL explains why random exploration works well in practice, since we show many environments can be solved by effectively estimating the random policy’s Q-function and then applying zero or a few steps of value iteration. We leverage SQIRL to derive instance-dependent sample complexity bounds for RL that are exponential only in an “effective horizon” of lookahead—which is typically much smaller than the full horizon—and on the complexity of the class used for function approximation. Empirically, we also find that SQIRL performance strongly correlates with PPO and DQN performance in a variety of stochastic environments, supporting that our theoretical analysis is predictive of practical performance.

Our experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous machine learning approaches in terms of speed and accuracy by one to two orders of magnitude on multiple different problems, including reaction-diffusion, and forced and unforced Navier-Stokes equations. When compared to numerical solvers of the same accuracy, our method demonstrates a $10\\\\times$ increase in performance speed.

On the other hand, training-based methods require fine-tuning the entire model, which is impractical for LMs of large scale. We present LitCab, a lightweight calibration mechanism consisting of a single linear layer that takes the input text representation and predicts a bias term, which is then added to the LM output logits. LitCab improves model calibration by only adding < 2% of the original model parameters. For evaluation, we construct CaT, a benchmark consisting of eight text generation tasks, covering responses ranging from short phrases to paragraphs. We test LitCab with Llama2-7B, where it improves calibration across all tasks, reducing the average ECE score by as large as 30%. We further conduct a comprehensive evaluation with multiple popular open-sourced LMs from GPT and LLaMA families, yielding the following key findings: (i) Larger models within the same family exhibit better calibration on tasks with short generation tasks, but not necessarily for longer ones. (ii) GPT-family models show superior calibration compared to LLaMA, Llama2, and Vicuna models, despite having much fewer parameters.

In this paper, we present the first study of the coherence of LLM-based book-length summarizers implemented via two prompting workflows: (1) hierarchically merging chunk-level summaries, and (2) incrementally updating a running summary. We obtain 1193 fine-grained human annotations on GPT-4 generated summaries of 100 recently-published books and identify eight common types of coherence errors made by LLMs. Because human evaluation is expensive and time-consuming, we develop an automatic metric, BooookScore, that measures the proportion of sentences in a summary that do not contain any of the identified error types. BooookScore has high agreement with human annotations and allows us to systematically evaluate the impact of many other critical parameters (e.g., chunk size, base LLM) while saving \\\\$15K USD and 500 hours in human evaluation costs. We find that closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude 2 produce summaries with higher BooookScore than those generated by open-source models. While LLaMA 2 falls behind other models, Mixtral achieves performance on par with GPT-3.5-Turbo.

Although most of them are still predominantly theoretical, a new practical paradigm enabled by the recent advent of CMOS-compatible room-temperature nature-based computers has emerged. By harnessing a dynamical system's intrinsic behavior of chasing the lowest energy state, this paradigm can solve some simple binary problems delivering considerable speedup and energy savings compared with NNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Regrettably, its values to the real world are highly constrained by its binary nature. A clear pathway to its extension to real-valued problems remains elusive. This paper aims to unleash this pathway by proposing a novel end-to-end Nature-Powered Graph Learning (NP-GL) framework. Specifically, through a three-dimensional co-design, NP-GL can leverage the spontaneous energy decrease in nature to efficiently solve real-valued graph learning problems.

Current defense strategies mainly address this vulnerability at the model parameter level, leaving the potential of architectural-level defense largely unexplored. This paper, for the first time, addresses the issue of model protection by reducing transferability at the architecture level. Specifically, we present a novel neural architecture search (NAS)-enabled algorithm that employs zero-cost proxies and evolutionary search, to explore model architectures with low transferability. Our method, namely ArchLock, aims to achieve high performance on the source task, while degrading the performance on potential target tasks, i.e., locking the transferability of a DNN model. To achieve efficient cross-task search without accurately knowing the training data owned by the attackers, we utilize zero-cost proxies to speed up architecture evaluation and simulate potential target task embeddings to assist cross-task search with a binary performance predictor. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and TransNAS-Bench-101 demonstrate that ArchLock reduces transferability by up to 30% and 50%, respectively, with negligible performance degradation on source tasks (<2%).

The precise nature of LLM capabilities is often mysterious, and different prompts can elicit different capabilities through in-context learning. We propose a framework that enables us to analyze in-context learning dynamics to understand latent concepts underlying LLMs’ behavioral patterns. This provides a more nuanced understanding than success-or-failure evaluation benchmarks, but does not require observing internal activations as a mechanistic interpretation of circuits would. Inspired by the cognitive science of human randomness perception, we use random binary sequences as context and study dynamics of in-context learning by manipulating properties of context data, such as sequence length. In the latest GPT-3.5+ models, we find emergent abilities to generate seemingly random numbers and learn basic formal languages, with striking in-context learning dynamics where model outputs transition sharply from seemingly random behaviors to deterministic repetition.\", \"keywords\": [\"in-context learning\", \"large language models\", \"interpretability\", \"computational cognitive science\"]}"}]}}
