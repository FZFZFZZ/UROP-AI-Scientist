{"id": "nDvgHIBRxQ", "abstract": "Exceptional mathematical reasoning ability is one of the key features that demonstrate the power of large language models (LLMs). How to comprehensively define and evaluate the mathematical abilities of LLMs, and even reflect the user experience in real-world scenarios, has emerged as a critical issue. Current benchmarks predominantly concentrate on problem-solving capabilities, presenting a substantial risk of model overfitting and fails to accurately measure the genuine mathematical reasoning abilities. In this paper, we argue that if a model really understands a problem, it should be robustly and readily applied across a diverse array of tasks. To this end, we introduce MathCheck, a well-designed checklist for testing task generalization and reasoning robustness, as well as an automatic tool to generate checklists efficiently. MathCheck includes multiple mathematical reasoning tasks and robustness tests to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of both mathematical reasoning ability and behavior testing. Utilizing MathCheck, we develop MathCheck-GSM and MathCheck-GEO to assess mathematical textual reasoning and multi-modal reasoning capabilities, respectively, serving as upgraded versions of benchmarks including GSM8k, GeoQA, UniGeo, and Geometry3K. We adopt MathCheck-GSM and MathCheck-GEO to evaluate over 26 LLMs and 17 multi-modal LLMs, assessing their comprehensive mathematical reasoning abilities. Our results demonstrate that while frontier LLMs like GPT-4o continue to excel in various abilities on the checklist, many other model families exhibit a significant decline. Further experiments indicate that, compared to traditional math benchmarks, MathCheck better reflects true mathematical abilities and represents mathematical intelligence more linearly, thereby supporting our design. Using MathCheck, we can also efficiently conduct informative behavior analysis to deeply investigate models. Finally, we show that our proposed checklist paradigm can easily extend to other reasoning tasks for their comprehensive evaluation."}
{"id": "ZsP3YbYeE9", "abstract": "A popular approach to building agents using Language Models (LMs) involves iteratively prompting the LM, reflecting on its outputs, and updating the input prompts until the desired task is achieved. However, our analysis reveals two key shortcomings in the existing methods: $(i)$ limited exploration of the decision space due to repetitive reflections, which result in redundant inputs, and $(ii)$ an inability to leverage insights from previously solved tasks. To address these issues, we introduce DoT (Diversity of Thoughts), a novel framework that a) explicitly reduces redundant reflections to enhance decision-space exploration, and b) incorporates a task-agnostic memory component to enable knowledge retrieval from previously solved tasks—unlike current approaches that operate in isolation for each task. Through extensive experiments on a suite of programming benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, and LeetCodeHardGym) using a variety of LMs, DoT demonstrates up to a $\\textbf{10}$% improvement in Pass@1 while maintaining cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, DoT is modular by design. For instance, when the diverse reflection module of DoT is integrated with existing methods like Tree of Thoughts (ToT), we observe a significant $\\textbf{13}$% improvement on Game of 24 (one of the main benchmarks of ToT), highlighting the broad applicability and impact of our contributions across various reasoning tasks."}

These are causally implicated subnetworks of human-interpretable features for explaining language model behaviors. Circuits identified in prior work consist of polysemantic and difficult-to-interpret units like attention heads or neurons, rendering them unsuitable for many downstream applications. In contrast, sparse feature circuits enable detailed understanding of unanticipated mechanisms in neural networks. Because they are based on fine-grained units, sparse feature circuits are useful for downstream tasks: We introduce SHIFT, where we improve the generalization of a classifier by ablating features that a human judges to be task-irrelevant. Finally, we demonstrate an entirely unsupervised and scalable interpretability pipeline by discovering thousands of sparse feature circuits for automatically discovered model behaviors."}

Weak-to-Strong mimics such a scenario where weak model supervision attempts to harness the full capabilities of a much stronger model. This work extends Weak-to-Strong to WeakS-to-Strong by exploring an ensemble of weak models which simulate the variability in human opinions. Confidence scores are estimated using a Bayesian approach to guide the WeakS-to-Strong generalization. Furthermore, we extend the application of WeakS-to-Strong from text classification tasks to text generation tasks where more advanced strategies are investigated for supervision. Moreover, direct preference optimization is applied to advance the student model's preference learning, beyond the basic learning framework of teacher forcing. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the reliability of a strong student model, showing potential for superalignment."}

{"id": "B2Fqu7Y2cd", "abstract": "Fugatto is a versatile audio synthesis and transformation model capable of following free-form text instructions with optional audio inputs. While large language models (LLMs) trained with text on a simple next-token prediction objective can learn to infer instructions directly from the data, models trained solely on audio data lack this capacity. This is because audio data does not inherently contain the instructions that were used to generate it. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a specialized dataset generation approach optimized for producing a wide range of audio generation and transformation tasks, ensuring the data reveals meaningful relationships between audio and language. Another challenge lies in achieving compositional abilities -- such as combining, interpolating between, or negating instructions -- using data alone. To address it, we propose ComposableART, an inference-time technique that extends classifier-free guidance to compositional guidance. It enables the seamless and flexible composition of instructions, leading to highly customizable audio outputs outside the training distribution. Our evaluations across a diverse set of tasks demonstrate that Fugatto performs competitively with specialized models, while ComposableART enhances its sonic palette and control over synthesis. Most notably, we highlight our framework's ability to execute emergent sounds and tasks -- sonic phenomena that transcend conventional audio generation -- unlocking new creative possibilities. \\href{https://fugatto.github.io/}{Demo Website.}"}

While deep reinforcement learning has achieved a number of successes in these domains, it is computationally intensive and time consuming, and therefore not suitable for solving large collections of tasks that require significant manual tuning. In this work, we introduce Model Predictive Control with Morphology-aware Proportional Control (MPC$^2$), a hierarchical model-based learning algorithm for zero-shot and near-real-time control of high-dimensional complex dynamical systems. MPC$^2$ uses a sampling-based model predictive controller for target posture planning, and enables robust control for high-dimensional tasks by incorporating a morphology-aware proportional controller for actuator coordination. The algorithm enables motion control of a high-dimensional human musculoskeletal model in a variety of motion tasks, such as standing, walking on different terrains, and imitating sports activities. The reward function of MPC$^2$ can be tuned via black-box optimization, drastically reducing the need for human-intensive reward engineering."}
{"id": "cmYScmfu4Q", "abstract": "Reward inference (learning a reward model from human preferences) is a critical intermediate step in the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) pipeline for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). In practice, RLHF faces fundamental challenges such as distribution shift, reward model overfitting, and problem misspecification. An alternative approach is direct policy optimization without reward inference, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which provides a much simpler pipeline and has shown empirical success in LLM applications. However, DPO utilizes the closed-form expression between the optimal policy and the reward function, which is only suitable under the bandit setting or deterministic MDPs. This paper develops two RLHF algorithms without reward inference for general RL problems beyond bandits and deterministic MDPs, and general preference models beyond the Bradley-Terry model. The key idea is to estimate the local value function difference from human preferences and then approximate the policy gradient with a zeroth-order gradient approximator. For both algorithms, we establish polynomial convergence rates in terms of the number of policy gradient iterations, the number of trajectory samples, and human preference queries per iteration. Numerical experiments in stochastic environments validate the performance of our proposed algorithms, outperforming popular RLHF baselines such as DPO and PPO. Our paper shows there exist provably efficient methods to solve general RLHF problems without reward inference."}
{"id": "6HcnC3pPkp", "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of test-time compute search strategies to improve the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the need for building robust verifiers has become increasingly important. However, all these inference strategies rely on existing verifiers originally designed for Best-of-N search, which makes them sub-optimal for tree search techniques at test time. During tree search, existing verifiers can only offer indirect and implicit assessments of partial solutions or under-value prospective intermediate steps, thus resulting in the premature pruning of promising intermediate steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose token-supervised value models (TVMs) -- a new class of verifiers that assign each token a probability that reflects the likelihood of reaching the correct final answer. This new token-level supervision enables TVMs to directly and explicitly evaluate partial solutions, effectively distinguishing between promising and incorrect intermediate steps during tree search at test time. Experimental results demonstrate that combining tree-search-based inference strategies with TVMs significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs in mathematical problem-solving tasks, surpassing the performance of existing verifiers."}

Using in-the-moment health data collected via ubiquitous devices (e.g., smartphones and smartwatches), this multidisciplinary field focuses on developing predictive models for certain health or well-being outcomes (e.g., depression and stress) in the short future given the time series of individual behaviors (e.g., resting heart rate, sleep quality, and current feelings). Yet, most existing models on these data, which we refer to as ubiquitous health data, do not achieve adequate accuracy. The latest works that yielded promising results have yet to consider realistic aspects of ubiquitous health data (e.g., containing features of different types and high rate of missing values) and the consumption of various resources (e.g., computing power, time, and cost). Given these two shortcomings, it is dubious whether these studies could translate to realistic settings. In this paper, we propose MuHBoost, a multi-label boosting method for addressing these shortcomings, by leveraging advanced methods in large language model (LLM) prompting and multi-label classification (MLC) to jointly predict multiple health or well-being outcomes. Because LLMs can hallucinate when tasked with answering multiple questions simultaneously, we also develop two variants of MuHBoost that alleviate this issue and thereby enhance its predictive performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate MuHBoost and its variants on 13 health and well-being prediction tasks defined from four realistic ubiquitous health datasets. Our results show that our three developed methods outperform all considered baselines across three standard MLC metrics, demonstrating their effectiveness while ensuring resource efficiency."}

{"id": "FpiCLJrSW8", "abstract": "The trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the extent to which their outputs are reliable, safe, and ethically aligned, and it has become a crucial consideration alongside their cognitive performance. In practice, Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely used to align LLMs with labeled human preferences, but its assumed effect on model trustworthiness hasn't been rigorously evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates how models aligned with general-purpose preference data perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. Our results demonstrate that RLHF on human preferences doesn't automatically guarantee trustworthiness, and reverse effects are often observed. Furthermore, we propose to adapt efficient influence function based data attribution methods to the RLHF setting to better understand the influence of fine-tuning data on individual trustworthiness benchmarks, and show its feasibility by providing our estimated attribution scores.

Most of the existing KV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by taking advantage of the different importance of tokens. However, most of these methods treat all layers equally, allocating the same KV budget to each layer. This approach is suboptimal, as some layers may be less sensitive to input tokens yet still receive the same budget as others. In this work, we found that by identifying the importance of attention layers, we could optimize the KV-cache jointly from two dimensions, i.e., sequence-wise and layer-wise. Based on our observations regarding layer-wise importance in inference, we propose \\sys to precisely optimize the allocation of KV-cache budget among layers on-the-fly and then incorporate three representative sequence-wise algorithms to compress the KV-cache for each layer with its very own budget. Specifically, we first measure each layer's importance by calculating the cosine similarity of the input prompt differences before and after the self-attention layers.

Recent research suggests that fine-tuning LLMs on carefully selected, task-specific subsets of data can match or even surpass the performance of using the entire dataset.  Building on these insights, we propose the Ensembles of Low-Rank Expert Adapters (ELREA) framework to improve the model's capability to handle diverse tasks.  ELREA clusters the training instructions based on their gradient directions, representing different areas of expertise and thereby reducing conflicts during optimization.  Expert adapters are then trained on these clusters, utilizing the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique to ensure training efficiency and model scalability.  During inference, ELREA combines predictions from the most relevant expert adapters based on the input data's gradient similarity to the training clusters, ensuring optimal adapter selection for each task.  Experiments show that our method outperforms baseline LoRA adapters trained on the full dataset and other ensemble approaches with similar training and inference complexity across a range of domain-specific tasks."}
{"id": "mFY0tPDWK8", "abstract": "Leveraging machine learning (ML) to predict an initial solution for mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has gained considerable popularity in recent years. These methods predict a solution and fix a subset of variables to reduce the problem dimension. Then, they solve the reduced problem to obtain the final solutions. However, directly fixing variable values can lead to low-quality solutions or even infeasible reduced problems if the predicted solution is not accurate enough. To address this challenge, we propose an Alternating prediction-correction neural solving framework (Apollo-MILP) that can identify and select accurate and reliable predicted values to fix. In each iteration, Apollo-MILP conducts a prediction step for the unfixed variables, followed by a correction step to obtain an improved solution (called reference solution) through a trust-region search. By incorporating the predicted and reference solutions, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-based Error upper BOund (UEBO) to evaluate the uncertainty of the predicted values and fix those with high confidence. A notable feature of Apollo-MILP is the superior ability for problem reduction while preserving optimality, leading to high-quality final solutions. Experiments on commonly used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed Apollo-MILP significantly outperforms other ML-based approaches in terms of solution quality, achieving over a 50% reduction in the solution gap."}

However, despite their high potential, most, if not all, existing graph diffusion models are limited in their ability to holistically describe the intrinsic higher-order topological graph properties, which obstructs model generalizability and adoption for downstream tasks. We address this fundamental challenge and extract the latent salient topological graph descriptors at different resolutions by leveraging zigzag persistence. We develop a new computationally efficient topological summary,\nzigzag spaghetti (ZS), which delivers the most inherent topological properties simultaneously over a sequence of graphs at multiple resolutions. We derive theoretical stability guarantees of ZS and present the first attempt to integrate\ndynamic topological information into graph diffusion models. Our extensive experiments on graph classification and prediction tasks suggest that ZS has a high promise not only to enhance performance of graph diffusion models, with gains up 10\\%, but also to substantially booster model robustness."}
{"id": "LBl7Hez0fF", "abstract": "Hallucination poses a challenge to the deployment of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in applications. Unlike in large language models (LLMs), hallucination in LVLMs often arises from misalignments between visual inputs and textual outputs. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of hallucination, focusing on the unique structure of LVLMs that distinguishes them from LLMs. We identify that hallucinations often arise from the sensitivity of text decoders to vision inputs, a natural phenomenon when image encoders and text decoders are pre-trained separately. Inspired by this, we introduce Visual and Textual Intervention (VTI), a novel technique designed to reduce hallucinations by steering latent space representations during inference to enhance the stability of vision features. As a task-agnostic test-time intervention, VTI can be easily applied to any problem without additional training costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can effectively reduce hallucinations and outperform baseline methods across multiple metrics, highlighting the critical role of vision feature stability in LVLMs."}

We introduce a single-view generalizable Human Gaussian Model (HGM), which employs a novel generate-then-refine pipeline with the guidance from human body prior and diffusion prior. Our approach uses a ControlNet to refine rendered back-view images from coarse predicted human Gaussians, then uses the refined image along with the input image to reconstruct refined human Gaussians. To mitigate the potential generation of unrealistic human poses and shapes, we incorporate human priors from the SMPL-X model as a dual branch, propagating image features from the SMPL-X volume to the image Gaussians using sparse convolution and attention mechanisms. Given that the initial SMPL-X estimation might be inaccurate, we gradually refine it with our HGM model. We validate our approach on several publicly available datasets. Our method surpasses previous methods in both novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction. Our approach also exhibits strong generalization for cross-dataset evaluation and in-the-wild images."}
{"id": "uHLgDEgiS5", "abstract": "Traditional data influence estimation methods, like influence function, assume that learning algorithms are permutation-invariant with respect to training data. However, modern training paradigms—especially for foundation models using stochastic algorithms and non-convergent, multi-stage curricula—are sensitive to data ordering, thus violating this assumption. This mismatch renders influence functions inadequate for answering some critical questions in current machine learning: How can we differentiate the influence of the same data contributing at different stages of training? More generally, how can we capture the dependence of data influence on the optimization trajectory during training? To address this gap, we formalize the concept of \\emph{trajectory-specific leave-one-out (LOO) influence}, which quantifies the impact of removing a data point from a specific iteration during training, accounting for the exact sequence of data encountered and the model's optimization trajectory. However, exactly evaluating the trajectory-specific LOO presents a significant computational challenge. To address this, we propose \\emph{data value embedding}, a novel technique enabling efficient approximation of trajectory-specific LOO. Specifically, we compute a training data embedding that encapsulates the cumulative interactions between data and the evolving model parameters. The LOO can then be efficiently approximated through a simple dot-product between the data value embedding and the gradient of the given test data. As data value embedding captures training data ordering, it offers valuable insights into model training dynamics. In particular, we uncover distinct phases of data influence, revealing that data points in the early and late stages of training exert a greater impact on the final model. These insights translate into actionable strategies for managing the computational overhead of data selection by strategically timing the selection process, potentially opening new avenues in data curation research."}

FHE enables computation directly on encrypted data, safeguarding the entire machine learning pipeline, including data and model confidentiality. However, existing FHE-based implementations for deep neural networks face significant challenges in computational cost, latency, and scalability, limiting their practical deployment. This paper introduces DCT-CryptoNets, a novel approach that operates directly in the frequency-domain to reduce the burden of computationally expensive non-linear activations and homomorphic bootstrap operations during private inference. It does so by utilizing the discrete cosine transform (DCT), commonly employed in JPEG encoding, which has inherent compatibility with remote computing services where images are generally stored and transmitted in this encoded format. DCT-CryptoNets demonstrates a substantial latency reductions of up to 5.3$\\times$ compared to prior work on benchmark image classification tasks. Notably, it demonstrates inference on the ImageNet dataset within 2.5 hours (down from 12.5 hours on equivalent 96-thread compute resources). Furthermore, by *learning* perceptually salient low-frequency information DCT-CryptoNets improves the reliability of encrypted predictions compared to RGB-based networks by reducing error accumulating homomorphic bootstrap operations. DCT-CryptoNets also demonstrates superior scalability to RGB-based networks by further reducing computational cost as image size increases.

Machine unlearning has emerged as a viable solution, aiming to remove specific training data, e.g., containing private information and bias, from models. In this paper, we study the machine unlearning problem in Image-to-Image (I2I) generative models. Previous studies mainly treat it as a single objective optimization problem, offering a solitary solution, thereby neglecting the varied user expectations towards the trade-off between complete unlearning and model utility. To address this issue, we propose a controllable unlearning framework that uses a control coefficient $\\epsilon$ to control the trade-off. We reformulate the I2I generative model unlearning problem into a $\\epsilon$-constrained optimization problem and solve it with a gradient-based method to find optimal solutions for unlearning boundaries. These boundaries define the valid range for the control coefficient. Within this range, every yielded solution is theoretically guaranteed with Pareto optimality.

This abstraction simplifies the transition dynamic by making specific future states easier to predict. We make use of this to propose a fully model-based algorithm that learns a discriminative world model, plans to explore efficiently with only a count-based intrinsic reward, and can subsequently plan to reach any discovered (abstract) states.\n\nWe demonstrate the model's ability to (i) efficiently solve single tasks, (ii) transfer zero-shot and few-shot across item types and environments, and (iii) plan across long horizons.

{"id": "t8fu5m8R5m", "abstract": "Despite significant progress in Anomaly Detection (AD), the robustness of existing detection methods against adversarial attacks remains a challenge, compromising their reliability in critical real-world applications such as autonomous driving. This issue primarily arises from the AD setup, which assumes that training data is limited to a group of unlabeled normal samples, making the detectors vulnerable to adversarial anomaly samples during testing. Additionally, implementing adversarial training as a safeguard encounters difficulties, such as formulating an effective objective function without access to labels. An ideal objective function for adversarial training in AD should promote strong perturbations both within and between the normal and anomaly groups to maximize margin between normal and anomaly distribution. To address these issues, we first propose crafting a pseudo-anomaly group derived from normal group samples. Then, we demonstrate that adversarial training with contrastive loss could serve as an ideal objective function, as it creates both inter- and intra-group perturbations. However, we notice that spurious negative pairs compromise the conventional contrastive loss for achieving robust AD. Spurious negative pairs are those that should be mapped closely but are erroneously separated. These pairs introduce noise and misguide the direction of inter-group adversarial perturbations. To overcome the effect of spurious negative pairs, we define opposite pairs and adversarially pull them apart to strengthen inter-group perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate our superior performance in both clean and adversarial scenarios, with a 26.1% improvement in robust detection across various challenging benchmark datasets."}
{"id": "fGhr39bqZa", "abstract": "Causal discovery with latent variables is an important and challenging problem. To identify latent variables and infer their causal relations, most existing works rely on the assumption that latent variables have pure children. Considering that this assumption is potentially restrictive in practice and not strictly necessary in theory, in this paper, by introducing the concept of homologous surrogate, we eliminate the need for pure children in the context of causal discovery with latent variables. The homologous surrogate fundamentally differs from the pure child in the sense that the latter is characterized by having strictly restricted parents while the former allows for much more flexible parents. We formulate two assumptions involving homologous surrogates and develop theoretical results under each assumption. Under the weaker assumption, our theoretical results imply that we can determine each variable's ancestors, that is, partially recover the causal graph. The stronger assumption further enables us to determine each variable's parents exactly, that is, fully recover the causal graph. Building on these theoretical results, we derive an algorithm that fully leverages the properties of homologous surrogates for causal graph recovery.

LGSD takes user prompts as input and outputs a set of semantically distinctive skills. The prompts serve as a means to constrain the search space into a semantically desired subspace, and the generated LLM outputs guide the agent to visit semantically diverse states within the subspace. We demonstrate that LGSD enables legged robots to visit different user-intended areas on a plane by simply changing the prompt.

Drawing an analogy with the concept of identifiability in statistics, which ensures the uniqueness of parameters inferred from data under specific modeling assumptions, we speak about the identifiability of explanations produced by MI.\n\nWe identify two broad strategies to produce MI explanations: (i) \"where-then-what\", which first identifies a subset of the network (a circuit) that replicates the model's behavior before deriving its interpretation, and (ii) \"what-then-where\", which begins with candidate explanatory algorithms and searches in the activation subspaces of the neural model where the candidate algorithm may be implemented, relying on notions of causal alignment between the states of the candidate algorithm and the neural network. \n\nWe systematically test the identifiability of both strategies using simple tasks (learning Boolean functions) and multi-layer perceptrons small enough to allow a complete enumeration of candidate explanations.

{"id": "yitH9xAHQs", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have significantly benefited from training on diverse, high-quality task-specific data, leading to impressive performance across a range of downstream applications. Current methods often rely on human-annotated data or predefined task templates to direct powerful LLMs in synthesizing task-relevant data for effective model training. However, this dependence on manually designed components may constrain the scope of generated data, potentially overlooking critical edge cases or novel scenarios that could challenge the model. In this paper, we present a novel approach, ReverseGen, designed to automatically generate effective training samples that expose the weaknesses of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a dedicated proposer trained to produce queries that lead target models to generate unsatisfactory responses.  These failure-inducing queries are then used to construct training data, helping to address the models' shortcomings and improve overall performance. Our approach is flexible and can be applied to models of various scales (3B, 7B, and 8B). We evaluate ReverseGen on three key applications—safety, honesty, and math—demonstrating that our generated data is both highly effective and diverse. Models fine-tuned with ReverseGen-generated data consistently outperform those trained on human-annotated or general model-generated data, offering a new perspective on data synthesis for task-specific LLM enhancement."}
{"id": "PUnD86UEK5", "abstract": "Adam outperforms SGD when training language models. Yet this advantage is not well-understood theoretically --  previous convergence analysis for Adam and SGD mainly focuses on the number of steps $T$ and is already minimax-optimal in non-convex cases, which are both $\\widetilde{O}(T^{-1/4})$. In this work, we argue that the exploitation of nice $\\ell_\\infty$-geometry is the key advantage of Adam over SGD. More specifically, we give a new convergence analysis for Adam under novel assumptions that loss is smooth under $\\ell_\\infty$-geometry rather than the more common $\\ell_2$-geometry, which yields a much better empirical smoothness constant for GPT-2 and ResNet models. Our experiments confirm that Adam performs much worse when the favorable $\\ell_\\infty$-geometry is changed while SGD provably remains unaffected. We also extend the convergence analysis to blockwise Adam under novel blockwise smoothness assumptions."}
{"id": "pPQPQ7Yd58", "abstract": "We initiate a study of the geometry of the visual representation space ---the information channel from the vision encoder to the action decoder--- in an image-based control pipeline learned from behavior cloning. Inspired by the phenomenon of *neural collapse* (NC) in image classification, we empirically demonstrate the prevalent emergence of a similar *law of clustering* in the visual representation space. Specifically, \n\n- In discrete image-based control (e.g., Lunar Lander), the visual representations cluster according to the natural discrete action labels;\n\n- In continuous image-based control (e.g., Planar Pushing and Block Stacking), the clustering emerges according to ``control-oriented'' classes that are based on (a) the relative pose between the object and the target in the input or (b) the relative pose of the object induced by expert actions in the output. Each of the classes corresponds to one relative pose orthant (REPO).\n\nBeyond empirical observation, we show such a law of clustering can be leveraged as an algorithmic tool to improve test-time performance when training a policy with limited expert demonstrations. Particularly, we pretrain the vision encoder using NC as a regularization to encourage control-oriented clustering of the visual features. Surprisingly, such an NC-pretrained vision encoder, when finetuned end-to-end with the action decoder, boosts the test-time performance by 10% to 35%. Real-world vision-based planar pushing experiments confirmed the surprising advantage of control-oriented visual representation pretraining."}

But not all inputs require the same amount of computation to process. Can we allocate decoding computation adaptively, using more resources to answer questions whose answers will be harder to compute? We present an approach that predicts the distribution of rewards given an input and computation budget, then allocates additional computation to inputs for which it is predicted to be most useful. We apply this approach in two decoding procedures: first, an adaptive best-of-$k$ procedure that dynamically selects the number of samples to generate as input to a reranker; second, a routing procedure that dynamically responds to a query using a decoding procedure that is expensive but accurate, or one that is cheaper but less capable. Across a suite of programming, mathematics, and dialog tasks, we show that accurate computation-allocation procedures can be learned, and reduce computation by up to 50% at no cost to quality."}
{"id": "hXm0Wu2U9K", "abstract": "Language model alignment methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) have led to impressive advances in language model capabilities, but are limited by a widely observed phenomenon known as *overoptimization*, where the quality of the language model degrades over the course of the alignment process. As the model optimizes performance on an offline reward model, it overfits to inaccuracies and drifts away from preferred responses covered by the data. To discourage such distribution shift, KL-regularization is widely employed in existing offline alignment methods, but overoptimization continues to harm performance. Lending theoretical insight into the source of these empirical observations, we first show that the KL-regularization is too weak to prevent overfitting, then ask: is it possible to design an efficient algorithm that is provably robust to overoptimization?\n\nIn this paper, we advance theoretical understanding of sample-efficient offline alignment and introduce a new algorithm called $\\chi^2$-Preference Optimization ($\\chi$PO). $\\chi$PO is a one-line change to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al. 2023), that modifies only the logarithmic link function in the DPO objective. Despite this minimal change, $\\chi$PO implicitly implements the principle of *pessimism in the face of uncertainty* via regularization with the $\\chi^2$-divergence---which quantifies uncertainty more effectively than KL-regularization---and provably alleviates overoptimization, achieving sample-complexity guarantees based on *single-policy concentrability*, the gold standard in offline reinforcement learning.

{"id": "d8hYXbxX71", "abstract": "Improving social welfare is a complex challenge requiring policymakers to optimize objectives across multiple time horizons. Evaluating the impact of such policies presents a fundamental challenge, as those that appear suboptimal in the short run may yield significant long-term benefits.  We tackle this challenge by analyzing the long-term dynamics of two prominent policy frameworks: Rawlsian policies, which prioritize those with the greatest need, and utilitarian policies, which maximize immediate welfare gains. Conventional wisdom suggests these policies are at odds, as Rawlsian policies are assumed to come at the cost of reducing the average social welfare, which their utilitarian counterparts directly optimize. We challenge this assumption by analyzing these policies in a sequential decision-making framework where individuals' welfare levels stochastically decay over time, and policymakers can intervene to prevent this decay. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that interventions following Rawlsian policies can outperform utilitarian policies in the long run, even when the latter dominate in the short run. We characterize the exact conditions under which Rawlsian policies can outperform utilitarian policies. We further illustrate our theoretical findings using simulations, which highlight the risks of evaluating policies based solely on their short-term effects. Our results underscore the necessity of considering long-term horizons in designing and evaluating welfare policies; the true efficacy of even well-established policies may only emerge over time."}
{"id": "G0dksFayVq", "abstract": "LLM-based judges have emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation and are increasingly used to assess, compare, and improve models. However, the reliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs become more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring stronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a judge’s alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more challenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of factual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we propose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging response pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench leverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into challenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges, fine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench poses a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many strong models (e.g. GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random guessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing increasingly advanced LLM-based judges. Data and code are available at \\url{https://github.com/ScalerLab/JudgeBench}."}
{"id": "vJkktqyU8B", "abstract": "While current Vision Transformer (ViT) adapter methods have shown promising accuracy, their inference speed is implicitly hindered by inefficient memory access operations, e.g., standard normalization and frequent reshaping. In this work, we propose META, a simple and fast ViT adapter that can improve the model's memory efficiency and decrease memory time consumption by reducing the inefficient memory access operations. Our method features a memory-efficient adapter block that enables the common sharing of layer normalization between the self-attention and feed-forward network layers, thereby reducing the model's reliance on normalization operations. Within the proposed block, the cross-shaped self-attention is employed to reduce the model's frequent reshaping operations. Moreover, we augment the adapter block with a lightweight convolutional branch that can enhance local inductive biases, particularly beneficial for the dense prediction tasks, e.g., object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The adapter block is finally formulated in a cascaded manner to compute diverse head features, thereby enriching the variety of feature representations. Empirically, extensive evaluations on multiple representative datasets validate that META substantially enhances the predicted quality, while achieving a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Theoretically, we demonstrate that META exhibits superior generalization capability and stronger adaptability."}

However, rendering quality significantly deteriorates when test views deviate from the camera angles used during training, posing a major challenge for applications in immersive free-viewpoint rendering and navigation. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 3DGS and related novel view synthesis methods under out-of-distribution (OOD) test camera scenarios. By creating diverse test cases with synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that most existing methods, including those incorporating various regularization techniques and data-driven priors, struggle to generalize effectively to OOD views. To address this limitation, we introduce SplatFormer, the first point transformer model specifically designed to operate on Gaussian splats. SplatFormer takes as input an initial 3DGS set optimized under limited training views and refines it in a single forward pass, effectively removing potential artifacts in OOD test views. To our knowledge, this is the first successful application of point transformers directly on 3DGS sets, surpassing the limitations of previous multi-scene training methods, which could handle only a restricted number of input views during inference. Our model significantly improves rendering quality under extreme novel views, achieving state-of-the-art performance in these challenging scenarios and outperforming various 3DGS regularization techniques, multi-scene models tailored for sparse view synthesis, and diffusion-based frameworks.

{"id": "ho4mNiwr2n", "abstract": "Anti-backdoor learning, aiming to train clean models directly from poisoned datasets, serves as an important defense method for backdoor attack. However, existing methods usually fail to recover backdoored samples to their original, correct labels and suffer from poor generalization to large pre-trained models due to its non end-to end training, making them unsuitable for protecting the increasingly prevalent large pre-trained models. To bridge the gap, we first revisit the anti-backdoor learning problem from a causal perspective. Our theoretical causal analysis reveals that incorporating \\emph{\\textbf{both}} images and the associated attack indicators preserves the model's integrity. Building on the theoretical analysis, we introduce an end-to-end method, Mind Control through Causal Inference (MCCI), to train clean models directly from poisoned datasets. This approach leverages both the image and the attack indicator to train the model. Based on this training paradigm, the model’s perception of whether an input is clean or backdoored can be controlled. Typically, by introducing fake non-attack indicators, the model perceives all inputs as clean and makes correct predictions, even for poisoned samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently recovering the original correct predictions for poisoned samples and enhancing accuracy on clean samples."}
{"id": "WwmtcGr4lP", "abstract": "Effective treatment of cancer is a major challenge faced by healthcare providers, due to the highly individualized nature of patient responses to treatment. This is caused by the heterogeneity seen in cancer-causing alterations (mutations) across patient genomes. Limited availability of response data in patients makes it difficult to train personalized treatment recommendation models on mutations from clinical genomic sequencing reports. Prior methods tackle this by utilising larger, labelled pre-clinical laboratory datasets (‘cell lines’), via transfer learning. These methods augment patient data by learning a shared, domain-invariant representation, between the cell line and patient domains, which is then used to train a downstream drug response prediction (DRP) model. This approach augments data in the shared space but fails to model patient-specific characteristics, which have a strong influence on their drug response. We propose a novel generative attention-based data augmentation and predictive modeling framework, GANDALF, to tackle this crucial shortcoming of prior methods. GANDALF not only augments patient genomic data directly, but also accounts for its domain-specific characteristics. GANDALF outperforms state-of-the-art DRP models on publicly available patient datasets and emerges as the front-runner amongst SOTA cancer DRP models."}

Inspired by Mallows' theory of preference ranking, we develop in this paper a new approach, the *MallowsPO*. A distinct feature of this approach is a  *dispersion index*, which reflects the dispersion of human preference to prompts. We show that existing DPO models can be reduced to special cases of this dispersion index, thus unified with MallowsPO. More importantly, we demonstrate empirically how to use this dispersion index to enhance the performance of DPO in a broad array of benchmark tasks, from synthetic bandit selection to controllable generation and dialogues, while maintaining great generalization capabilities.

For example, while AI systems struggle to determine whether two such objects are visually the same or different, humans can do so with ease. Active vision theories postulate that the learning of visual relations is grounded in actions that we take to fixate objects and their parts by moving our eyes. In particular, the low-dimensional spatial information about the corresponding eye movements is hypothesized to facilitate the representation of relations between different image parts. Inspired by these theories, we develop a system equipped with a novel Glimpse-based Active Perception (GAP) that sequentially glimpses at the most salient regions of the input image and processes them at high resolution. Importantly, our system leverages the locations stemming from the glimpsing actions, along with the visual content around them, to represent relations between different parts of the image.

In this paper, we introduce novel algorithms for dynamic, instance-level data reweighting aimed at improving both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining. Our methods adjust the weight of each training sample based on its loss value in an online fashion, allowing the model to dynamically focus on more informative or important samples at the current training stage.

The increasing capacity of LLMs to process longer input sequences opens up avenues for providing more retrieved information, to potentially enhance the quality of generated outputs.

In open-world scenarios, models often encounter noisy samples, i.e., samples outside the in-distribution (ID) label space. Leveraging the zero-shot capability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), this paper introduces Zero-Shot Noisy TTA (ZS-NTTA), focusing on adapting the model to target data with noisy samples during test-time in a zero-shot manner. In the preliminary study, we reveal that existing TTA methods suffer from a severe performance decline under ZS-NTTA, often lagging behind even the frozen model. We conduct comprehensive experiments to analyze this phenomenon, revealing that the negative impact of unfiltered noisy data outweighs the benefits of clean data during model updating. In addition, as these methods adopt the adapting classifier to implement ID classification and noise detection sub-tasks, the ability of the model in both sub-tasks is largely hampered. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel framework that decouples the classifier and detector, focusing on developing an individual detector while keeping the classifier (including the backbone) frozen. Technically, we introduce the Adaptive Noise Detector (AdaND), which utilizes the frozen model's outputs as pseudo-labels to train a noise detector for detecting noisy samples effectively. To address clean data streams, we further inject Gaussian noise during adaptation, preventing the detector from misclassifying clean samples as noisy. Beyond the ZS-NTTA, AdaND can also improve the zero-shot out-of-distribution (ZS-OOD) detection ability of VLMs. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms in both ZS-NTTA and ZS-OOD detection.

While intriguing, this delayed generalization phenomenon compromises predictability and efficiency. Ideally, models should generalize directly without delay. To this end, this paper proposes GrokTransfer, a simple and principled method for accelerating grokking in training neural networks, based on the key observation that data embedding plays a\ncrucial role in determining whether generalization is delayed. GrokTransfer first trains a smaller, weaker model to reach a nontrivial (but far from optimal) test performance. Then, the learned input embedding from this weaker model is extracted and used to initialize the embedding in the target, stronger model. We rigorously prove that, on a synthetic XOR task where delayed generalization always\noccurs in normal training, GrokTransfer enables the target model to generalize directly without delay.

Additionally, we introduce a learnable form of this divergence using permutation-invariant neural networks (NNs) and demonstrate through experiments that it effectively captures key structural properties in discrete data. As a result, the proposed method significantly improves the performance of existing methods on tasks such as clustering and set retrieval problems. This work addresses the challenge of defining meaningful divergences in discrete settings and provides a new tool for tasks requiring structure-preserving distance measures."}
{"id": "2e4ECh0ikn", "abstract": "The recent wave of audio foundation models (FMs) could provide new capabilities for conversational modeling. However, there have been limited efforts to evaluate these audio FMs comprehensively on their ability to have natural and interactive conversations. To engage in meaningful conversation with the end user, we would want the FMs to additionally perform a fluent succession of turns without too much overlapping speech or long stretches of silence. Inspired by this, we ask whether the recently proposed audio FMs can understand, predict, and perform turn-taking events? To answer this, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that can assess spoken dialog system's turn-taking capabilities using a supervised model as a judge that has been trained to predict turn-taking events in human-human conversations. Using this protocol, we present the first comprehensive user study that evaluates existing spoken dialogue systems on their ability to perform turn-taking events and reveal many interesting insights, such as they sometimes do not understand when to speak up, can interrupt too aggressively and rarely backchannel. We further evaluate multiple open-source and proprietary audio FMs accessible through APIs on carefully curated test benchmarks from Switchboard to measure their ability to understand and predict turn-taking events and identify significant room for improvement. We will open source our evaluation platform to promote the development of advanced conversational AI systems."}

However, transferring image-level knowledge to pixel-level tasks, such as lesion segmentation in 3D CT scans, remains a critical challenge. Due to the complexity and variability of pathological visual characteristics, existing methods struggle to align fine-grained lesion features not encountered during training with disease-related textual representations. In this paper, we present Malenia, a novel multi-scale lesion-level mask-attribute alignment framework, specifically designed for 3D zero-shot lesion segmentation. Malenia improves the compatibility between mask representations and their associated elemental attributes, explicitly linking the visual features of unseen lesions with the extensible knowledge learned from previously seen ones. Furthermore, we design a Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection module to enhance both visual and textual features with mutually beneficial information, effectively guiding the generation of segmentation results. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets and 12 lesion categories validate the superior performance of Malenia."}
{"id": "X9OfMNNepI", "abstract": "Scientific discovery contributes largely to the prosperity of human society, and recent progress shows that LLMs could potentially catalyst the process. However, it is still unclear whether LLMs can discover novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate this main research question: whether LLMs can automatically discover novel and valid chemistry research hypotheses, given only a research question? With extensive discussions with chemistry experts, we adopt the assumption that a majority of chemistry hypotheses can be resulted from a research background question and several inspirations. With this key insight, we break the main question into three smaller fundamental questions. In brief, they are: (1) given a background question, whether LLMs can retrieve good inspirations; (2) with background and inspirations, whether LLMs can lead to hypothesis; and (3) whether LLMs can identify good hypotheses to rank them higher. To investigate these questions, we construct a benchmark consisting of 51 chemistry papers published in Nature or a similar level in 2024 (all papers are only available online since 2024). Every paper is divided by chemistry PhD students into three components: background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The goal is to rediscover the hypothesis given only the background and a large chemistry literature corpus consisting the ground truth inspiration papers, with LLMs trained with data up to 2023. We also develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework that leverages the assumption, consisting of three stages reflecting the more smaller questions. The proposed method can rediscover many hypotheses with very high similarity with the ground truth ones, covering the main innovations."}
{"id": "keu6sxrPWn", "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) grow more powerful, they also become more difficult to trust. They could be either aligned with human intentions, or exhibit \"subversive misalignment\" -- introducing subtle errors that bypass safety checks. Although individual errors may not immediately cause harm, each increases the risk of an eventual safety failure. With this uncertainty, model deployment often grapples with the tradeoff between ensuring safety and harnessing the capabilities of untrusted models. In this work, we introduce the ``Diffuse Risk Management'' problem, aiming to balance the average-case safety and usefulness in the deployment of untrusted models over a large sequence of tasks. We approach this problem by developing a two-level framework: the single-task level (micro-protocol) and the whole-scenario level (macro-protocol). At the single-task level, we develop various \\textit{micro}-protocols that use a less capable, but extensively tested (trusted) model to harness and monitor the untrusted model. At the whole-scenario level, we find an optimal \\textit{macro}-protocol that uses an adaptive estimate of the untrusted model's risk to choose between micro-protocols. To evaluate the robustness of our method, we follow \\textit{control evaluations} in a code generation testbed, which involves a red team attempting to generate subtly backdoored code with an LLM whose deployment is safeguarded by a blue team. Experiment results show that our approach retains 99.6\\% usefulness of the untrusted model while ensuring near-perfect safety, significantly outperforming existing deployment methods. Our approach also demonstrates robustness when the trusted and untrusted models have a large capability gap. Our findings demonstrate the promise of managing diffuse risks in the deployment of increasingly capable but untrusted LLMs."}
{"id": "2ZK8zyIt7o", "abstract": "The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has enabled them to generate unprecedented results from given texts. However, as text inputs become longer, existing encoding methods like CLIP face limitations, and aligning the generated images with long texts becomes challenging. To tackle these issues, we propose LongAlign, which includes a segment-level encoding method for processing long texts and a decomposed preference optimization method for effective alignment training. For segment-level encoding, long texts are divided into multiple segments and processed separately. This method overcomes the maximum input length limits of pretrained encoding models. For preference optimization, we provide decomposed CLIP-based preference models to fine-tune diffusion models. Specifically, to utilize CLIP-based preference models for T2I alignment, we delve into their scoring mechanisms and find that the preference scores can be decomposed into two components: a text-relevant part that measures T2I alignment and a text-irrelevant part that assesses other visual aspects of human preference. Additionally, we find that the text-irrelevant part contributes to a common overfitting problem during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose a reweighting strategy that assigns different weights to these two components, thereby reducing overfitting and enhancing alignment. After fine-tuning $512 \\\\times 512$ Stable Diffusion (SD) v1.5 for about 20 hours using our method, the fine-tuned SD outperforms stronger foundation models in T2I alignment, such as PixArt-$\\\\alpha$ and Kandinsky v2.2.

{"id": "e8qXTxMgPg", "abstract": "We study beyond worst-case dimensionality reduction for $s$-sparse vectors (vectors with at most $s$ non-zero coordinates). Our work is divided into two parts, each focusing on a different facet of beyond worst-case analysis:\n\n\\noindent (a)  We first consider average-case guarantees for embedding $s$-sparse vectors. Here, a well-known folklore upper bound based on the birthday-paradox states: For any collection $X$ of $s$-sparse vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists a linear map $A: \\mathbb{R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{O(s^2)}$ which \\emph{exactly} preserves the norm of $99\\%$ of the vectors in $X$ in any $\\ell_p$ norm (as opposed to the usual setting where guarantees hold for all vectors). We provide novel lower bounds showing that this is indeed optimal in many settings. Specifically, any oblivious linear map satisfying similar average-case guarantees must map to $\\Omega(s^2)$ dimensions. The same lower bound also holds for a wider class of sufficiently smooth maps, including `encoder-decoder schemes', where we compare the norm of the original vector to that of a smooth function of the embedding. These lower bounds reveal a surprising separation result for smooth embeddings of sparse vectors, as an upper bound of $O(s \\log(d))$ is possible if we instead use arbitrary functions, e.g., via compressed sensing algorithms.\n\n\n (b) Given these lower bounds, we specialize to sparse \\emph{non-negative} vectors to hopes of improved upper bounds. For a dataset $X$ of non-negative $s$-sparse vectors and any $p \\ge 1$, we can non-linearly embed $X$ to $O(s\\log(|X|s)/\\varepsilon^2)$ dimensions while preserving all pairwise distances in $\\ell_p$ norm up to $1\\pm \\varepsilon$, with no dependence on $p$. Surprisingly, the non-negativity assumption enables much smaller embeddings than arbitrary sparse vectors, where the best known bound suffers an exponential $(\\log |X|)^{O(p)}$ dependence. Our map also guarantees \\emph{exact} dimensionality reduction for the $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm by embedding $X$ into $O(s\\log |X|)$ dimensions, which is tight. We further give separation results showing that both the non-linearity of $f$ and the non-negativity of $X$ are necessary, and provide downstream algorithmic improvements using our embedding."}
{"id": "Wvi8c0tgvt", "abstract": "Existing realistic blur datasets provide insufficient variety in scenes and blur patterns to be trained, while expanding data diversity demands considerable time and effort due to complex dual-camera systems. To address the challenge, data augmentation can be an effective way to artificially increase data diversity. However, existing methods on this line are typically designed to estimate motions from a 2D perspective, e.g., estimating 2D non-uniform kernels disregarding 3D aspects of blur modeling, which leads to unrealistic motion patterns due to the fact that camera and object motions inherently arise in 3D space. In this paper, we propose a 3D-aware blur synthesizer capable of generating diverse and realistic blur images for blur data augmentation. Specifically, we estimate 3D camera positions within the motion blur interval, generate the corresponding scene images, and aggregate them to synthesize a realistic blur image. Since the 3D camera positions projected onto the 2D image plane inherently lie in 2D space, we can represent the 3D transformation as a combination of 2D transformation and projected 3D residual component. This allows for 3D transformation without requiring explicit depth measurements, as the 3D residual component is directly estimated via a neural network. Furthermore, our blur synthesizer allows for controllable blur data augmentation by modifying blur magnitude, direction, and scenes, resulting in diverse blur images. As a result, our method significantly improves deblurring performance, making it more practical for real-world scenarios."}

In this paper, we introduce SeedLM, a novel post-training compression method that uses seeds of a pseudo-random generator to encode and compress model weights.

This matrix is then linearly combined with compressed coefficients to reconstruct the weight block. SeedLM reduces memory access and leverages idle compute cycles during inference, effectively speeding up memory-bound tasks by trading compute for fewer memory accesses. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that rely on calibration data, our approach is data-free and generalizes well across diverse tasks. Our experiments with Llama3 70B, which is particularly challenging, show zero-shot accuracy retention at 4- and 3-bit compression to be on par with or better than state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining performance comparable to FP16 baselines.

This library is designed to simultaneously simplify the development of tasks and cohorts for ML in healthcare and also enable their reproduction, both at an exact level for single datasets and at a conceptual level across datasets.

Previously, camera-aware methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they are largely confined to training domains of the models. We measure the camera bias of ReID models on unseen domains and reveal that camera bias becomes more pronounced under data distribution shifts. As a debiasing method for unseen domain data, we revisit feature normalization on embedding vectors. While the normalization has been used as a straightforward solution, its underlying causes and broader applicability remain unexplored. We analyze why this simple method is effective at reducing bias and show that it can be applied to detailed bias factors such as low-level image properties and body angle. Furthermore, we validate its generalizability across various models and benchmarks, highlighting its potential as a simple yet effective test-time postprocessing method for ReID. In addition, we explore the inherent risk of camera bias in unsupervised learning of ReID models. The unsupervised models remain highly biased towards camera labels even for seen domain data, indicating substantial room for improvement.

This approach edits pre-trained models directly in weight space by combining the fine-tuned weights of various tasks into a *unified model*. Its efficiency and cost-effectiveness stem from its training-free combination, contrasting with traditional methods that require model training on large datasets for multiple tasks. However, applying such a unified model to individual tasks can lead to interference from other tasks (lack of *weight disentanglement*). To address this issue, Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) linearization has been employed to leverage a ''kernel behavior'', facilitating weight disentanglement and mitigating adverse effects from unrelated tasks. Despite its benefits, NTK linearization presents drawbacks, including doubled training costs, as well as reduced performance of individual models. To tackle this problem, we propose a simple yet effective and efficient method that is to finetune the attention modules only in the Transformer. Our study reveals that the attention modules exhibit kernel behavior, and fine-tuning the attention modules only significantly improves weight disentanglement. To further understand how our method improves the weight disentanglement of task arithmetic, we present a comprehensive study of task arithmetic by differentiating the role of the representation module and task-specific module. In particular, we find that the representation module plays an important role in improving weight disentanglement whereas the task-specific modules such as the classification heads can degenerate the weight disentanglement performance."}

However, optimizing such real-world industrial systems faces numerous challenges, including but not limited to a lack of reliable simulation environments, limited historical data, and stringent safety and control robustness requirements. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework for energy efficiency optimization of DC cooling systems. The proposed framework models the complex dynamical patterns and physical dependencies inside a server room using a purposely designed graph neural network architecture that is compliant with the fundamental time-reversal symmetry. Because of its well-behaved and generalizable state-action representations, the model enables sample-efficient and robust latent space offline policy learning using limited real-world operational data. Our framework has been successfully deployed and verified in a large-scale production DC for closed-loop control of its air-cooling units (ACUs). We conducted a total of 2000 hours of short and long-term experiments in the production DC environment. The results show that our method achieves 14-21% energy savings in the DC cooling system, without any violation of the safety or operational constraints.

MathGAP generates problem statements and chain-of-thought reasoning traces according to specifications about their arithmetic proof structure, enabling systematic studies on easy-to-hard generalization with respect to complexity of proof trees. Using MathGAP, we find that LLMs show a significant decrease in performance as proofs get deeper and wider. This effect is more pronounced in complex, nonlinear proof structures, which are challenging even for the most capable models. The models are also sensitive to simple changes in sentence ordering.

This framework enhances the localization accuracy of state-of-the-art absolute pose regression and scene coordinate regression methods. The 3DGS model renders high-quality synthetic images and depth maps to facilitate the establishment of 2D-3D correspondences. GS-CPR obviates the need for training feature extractors or descriptors by operating directly on RGB images, utilizing the 3D foundation model, MASt3R, for precise 2D matching. To improve the robustness of our model in challenging outdoor environments, we incorporate an exposure-adaptive module within the 3DGS framework. Consequently, GS-CPR enables efficient one-shot pose refinement given a single RGB query and a coarse initial pose estimation. Our proposed approach surpasses leading NeRF-based optimization methods in both accuracy and runtime across indoor and outdoor visual localization benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy on two indoor datasets."}
{"id": "j7cyANIAxV", "abstract": "Drug-target binding affinity prediction is a fundamental task for drug discovery. It has been extensively explored in literature and promising results are reported. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that the results may be misleading and cannot be well generalized to real practice. The core observation is that the canonical randomized split of a test set in conventional evaluation leaves the test set dominated by samples with high similarity to the training set. The performance of models is severely degraded on samples with lower similarity to the training set but the drawback is highly overlooked in current evaluation. As a result, the performance can hardly be trusted when the model meets low-similarity samples in real practice. To address this problem, we propose a framework of similarity aware evaluation in which a novel split methodology is proposed to adapt to any desired distribution. This is achieved by a formulation of optimization problems which are approximately and efficiently solved by gradient descent. We perform extensive experiments across five representative methods in four datasets for two typical target evaluations and compare them with various counterpart methods. Results demonstrate that the proposed split methodology can significantly better fit desired distributions and guide the development of models."}

{"id": "kGvXIlIVLM", "abstract": "Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a critical technique for enhancing the sample quality of visual generative models. However, in autoregressive (AR) multi-modal generation, CFG introduces design inconsistencies between language and visual content, contradicting the design philosophy of unifying different modalities for visual AR. Motivated by language model alignment methods, we propose Condition Contrastive Alignment (CCA) to facilitate guidance-free AR visual generation. Unlike guidance methods that alter the sampling process to achieve the ideal sampling distribution, CCA directly fine-tunes pretrained models to fit the same distribution target. Experimental results show that CCA can significantly enhance the guidance-free performance of all tested models with just one epoch of fine-tuning (1% of pretraining epochs) on the pretraining dataset. This largely removes the need for guided sampling in AR visual generation and cuts the sampling cost by half. Moreover, by adjusting training parameters, CCA can achieve trade-offs between sample diversity and fidelity similar to CFG. This experimentally confirms the strong theoretical connection between language-targeted alignment and visual-targeted guidance methods, unifying two previously independent research fields."}

However, traditional drug development methods are costly and inefficient. Recognizing the pressing need for more effective solutions, researchers have turned to machine learning techniques to streamline the prediction and development of novel antibiotic compounds. While foundation models have shown promise in antibiotic discovery, current mainstream efforts still fall short of fully leveraging the potential of multimodal molecular data. Recent studies suggest that contrastive learning frameworks utilizing multimodal data exhibit excellent performance in representation learning across various domains. Building upon this, we introduce CL-MFAP, an unsupervised contrastive learning (CL)-based multimodal foundation (MF) model specifically tailored for discovering small molecules with potential antibiotic properties (AP) using three types of molecular data. This model employs 1.6 million bioactive molecules with drug-like properties from the ChEMBL dataset to jointly pretrain three encoders: (1) a transformer-based encoder with rotary position embedding for processing SMILES strings; (2) another transformer-based encoder, incorporating a novel bi-level routing attention mechanism to handle molecular graph representations; and (3) a Morgan fingerprint encoder using a multilayer perceptron, to achieve the contrastive learning purpose. The CL-MFAP outperforms baseline models in antibiotic property prediction by effectively utilizing different molecular modalities and demonstrates superior domain-specific performance when fine-tuned for antibiotic-related property prediction tasks."}
{"id": "dOAkHmsjRX", "abstract": "The majority of online continual learning (CL) advocates single-epoch training and imposes restrictions on the size of replay memory. However, single-epoch training would incur a different amount of computations per CL algorithm, and the additional storage cost to store logit or model in addition to replay memory is largely ignored in calculating the storage budget. Arguing different computational and storage budgets hinder fair comparison among CL algorithms in practice, we propose to use floating point operations (FLOPs) and total memory size in Byte as a metric for computational and memory budgets, respectively, to compare and develop CL algorithms in the same ‘total resource budget.’ To improve a CL method in a limited total budget, we propose adaptive layer freezing that does not update the layers for less informative batches to reduce computational costs with a negligible loss of accuracy. In addition, we propose a memory retrieval method that allows the model to learn the same amount of knowledge as using random retrieval in fewer iterations. Empirical validations on the CIFAR-10/100, CLEAR-10/100, and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods within the same total budget.

Being stationary, we demonstrate that Matérn kernels allow for tunable surface reconstruction in the same way as Fourier feature mappings help coordinate-based MLPs overcome spectral bias. Moreover, we theoretically analyze Matérn kernels' connection to SIREN networks as well as their relation to previously employed arc-cosine kernels. Finally, based on recently introduced Neural Kernel Fields, we present data-dependent Matérn kernels and conclude that especially the Laplace kernel (being part of the Matérn family) is extremely competitive, performing almost on par with state-of-the-art methods in the noise-free case while having a more than five times shorter training time."}

In this paper, we take a step further and investigate how well dot product and cosine similarity are preserved by random projections when these are applied over the rows of the graph matrix. Our analysis provides new asymptotic and finite-sample results, identifies pathological cases, and tests them with numerical experiments. We specialize our fundamental results to a ranking application by computing the probability of random projections flipping the node ordering induced by their embeddings.

With respect to the statistical noise introduced by random projections, we show that cosine similarity produces remarkably more precise approximations."}
{"id": "2ATD8a8P3C", "abstract": "Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a promising strategy for quantifying the uncertainty of a predictive model; these algorithms modify the model to output sets of labels that are guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability. However, existing conformal prediction algorithms have largely targeted classification and regression settings, where the structure of the prediction set has a simple form as a level set of the scoring function. However, for complex structured outputs such as text generation, these prediction sets might include a large number of labels and therefore be hard for users to interpret. In this paper, we propose a general framework for conformal prediction in the structured prediction setting, that modifies existing conformal prediction algorithms to output structured prediction sets that implicitly represent sets of labels. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach can be applied in domains where the prediction sets can be represented as a set of nodes in a directed acyclic graph; for instance, for hierarchical labels such as image classification, a prediction set might be a small subset of coarse labels implicitly representing the prediction set of all their more fine-descendants. We demonstrate how our algorithm can be used to construct prediction sets that satisfy a desired coverage guarantee in several domains."}
{"id": "2MLvV7fvAz", "abstract": "Can integrating spectral and curvature signals unlock new potential in graph representation learning? Non-Euclidean geometries, particularly Riemannian manifolds such as hyperbolic (negative curvature) and spherical (positive curvature), offer powerful inductive biases for embedding complex graph structures like scale-free, hierarchical, and cyclic patterns. Meanwhile, spectral filtering excels at processing signal variations across graphs, making it effective in homophilic and heterophilic settings. Leveraging both can significantly enhance the learned representations. To this end, we propose Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (CUSP) - the first graph representation learning paradigm that unifies both CUrvature (geometric) and SPectral insights. CUSP is a mixed-curvature spectral GNN that learns spectral filters to optimize node embeddings in products of constant curvature manifolds (hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean). Specifically, CUSP introduces three novel components: (a) Cusp Laplacian, an extension of the traditional graph Laplacian based on Ollivier-Ricci curvature, designed to capture the curvature signals better; (b) Cusp Filtering, which employs multiple Riemannian graph filters to obtain cues from various bands in the eigenspectrum; and (c) Cusp Pooling, a hierarchical attention mechanism combined with a curvature-based positional encoding to assess the relative importance of differently curved substructures in our graph. Empirical evaluation across eight homophilic and heterophilic datasets demonstrates the superiority of CUSP in node classification and link prediction tasks, with a gain of up to 5.3\\% over state-of-the-art models."}
{"id": "din0lGfZFd", "abstract": "Large language models have shown remarkable reasoning abilities and scaling laws suggest that large parameter count, especially along the depth axis, is the primary driver. In this work, we make a stronger claim --- many reasoning problems require a large depth but not necessarily many parameters. This unlocks a novel application of looped models for reasoning. Firstly, we show that for many synthetic reasoning problems like addition, $p$-hop induction, and math problems, a $k$-layer transformer looped $L$ times nearly matches the performance of a $kL$-layer non-looped model, and is significantly better than a $k$-layer model. This is further corroborated by theoretical results showing that many such reasoning problems can be solved via iterative algorithms, and thus, can be solved effectively using looped models with nearly optimal depth. Perhaps surprisingly, these benefits also translate to practical settings of language modeling --- on many downstream reasoning tasks, a language model with $k$-layers looped $L$ times can be competitive to, if not better than, a $kL$-layer language model. In fact, our empirical analysis reveals an intriguing phenomenon: looped and non-looped models exhibit scaling behavior that depends on their effective depth, akin to the inference-time scaling of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We further elucidate the connection to CoT reasoning by proving that looped models implicitly generate latent thoughts and can simulate $T$ steps of CoT with $T$ loops. Inspired by these findings, we also present an interesting dichotomy between reasoning and memorization, and design a looping-based regularization that is effective on both fronts."}
{"id": "VmJdqhuTCh", "abstract": "We present a novel frequency-based Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) approach that significantly enhances its efficacy for pre-training. Prior work in this direction masks out pre-defined frequencies in the input image and employs a reconstruction loss to pre-train the model. While achieving promising results, such an implementation has two fundamental limitations as identified in our paper. First, using pre-defined frequencies overlooks the variability of image frequency responses. Second, pre-trained with frequency-filtered images, the resulting model needs relatively more data to adapt to naturally looking images during fine-tuning. To address these drawbacks, we propose FOurier transform compression with seLf-Knowledge distillation (FOLK), integrating two dedicated ideas. First, inspired by image compression, we adaptively select the masked-out frequencies based on image frequency responses, creating more suitable SSL tasks for pre-training. Second, we employ a two-branch framework empowered by knowledge distillation, enabling the model to take both the filtered and original images as input, largely reducing the burden of downstream tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FOLK in achieving competitive performance to many state-of-the-art SSL methods across various downstream tasks, including image classification, few-shot learning, and semantic segmentation."}

In this work, we introduce a novel framework, Discriminator-Guided Action Optimization (DGAP), for facilitating the optimization of LLM action plans via step-wise signals. Specifically, we employ a limited set of demonstrations to enable the discriminator to learn a score function, which assesses the alignment between LLM-generated actions and the underlying optimal ones at every step. Based on the discriminator, LLMs are prompted to generate actions that maximize the score, utilizing historical action-score pair trajectories as guidance. Under mild conditions, DGAP resembles critic-regularized optimization and has been demonstrated to achieve a stronger policy than the LLM planner.

From this results, we derive how separability is influenced by hyperparameters and architectural choices—such as activation functions, depth, hidden layer width, and representation types. Notably, all non-polynomial activations, including ReLU and sigmoid, are equivalent in expressivity and reach maximum separation power. Depth improves separation power up to a threshold, after which further increases have no effect. Adding invariant features to hidden representations does not impact separation power.

We also construct a StreamingChat model, which significantly outperforms open-source LVLMs on our SVBench and achieves comparable performance on diverse vision-language benchmarks. We expect SVBench to advance the research of streaming video understanding by providing a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of current LVLMs. Our benchmark and model can be accessed at https://yzy-bupt.github.io/SVBench."}

Traditional algorithms require retraining from scratch when new variables are introduced, making them impractical for dynamic or large-scale applications. In this paper, we propose an extendable structure learning strategy that efficiently incorporates a new variable $Y$ into an existing Bayesian network graph $\\mathcal{G}$ over variables $\\mathcal{X}$, resulting in an updated P-map graph $\\bar{\\mathcal{G}}$ on $\\bar{\\mathcal{X}} = \\mathcal{X} \\cup \\{Y\\}$. By leveraging the information encoded in $\\mathcal{G}$, our method significantly reduces computational overhead compared to learning $\\bar{\\mathcal{G}}$ from scratch. Empirical evaluations demonstrate runtime reductions of up to 1300x without compromising accuracy. Building on this approach, we introduce a novel iterative paradigm for structure learning over $\\mathcal{X}$. Starting with a small subset $\\mathcal{U} \\subset \\mathcal{X}$, we iteratively add the remaining variables using our extendable algorithms to construct a P-map graph over the full set.

However, current image-to-video diffusion models, while powerful in generating videos from a single conditioning frame, need adaptation for two-frame (start \\& end) conditioned generation, which is essential for effective bounded interpolation. Unfortunately, existing approaches that fuse temporally forward and backward paths in parallel often suffer from off-manifold issues, leading to artifacts or requiring multiple iterative re-noising steps. In this work, we introduce a novel, bidirectional sampling strategy to address these off-manifold issues without requiring extensive re-noising or fine-tuning. Our method employs sequential sampling along both forward and backward paths, conditioned on the start and end frames, respectively, ensuring more coherent and on-manifold generation of intermediate frames. Additionally, we incorporate advanced guidance techniques, CFG++ and DDS, to further enhance the interpolation process. By integrating these, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently generating high-quality, smooth videos between keyframes. On a single 3090 GPU, our method can interpolate 25 frames at 1024$\\times$576 resolution in just 195 seconds, establishing it as a leading solution for keyframe interpolation.\nProject page: https://vibidsampler.github.io/"}

To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a \\textit{``Spread Out in the End``} information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability. Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of \\textit{language family} experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters."}

Mamba has established itself as a leading model within this emerging paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art results in various language modeling benchmarks. However, despite its impressive performance, Mamba's effectiveness is limited by its pre-training context length, resulting in a pronounced degradation when the model is tasked with handling longer contexts. Our investigation reveals that Mamba's inability to generalize effectively to long contexts is primarily due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) discretization steps. To address this critical limitation, we introduce _**MambaExtend**_, a novel framework designed to significantly enhance the context extension capabilities of Mamba. Specifically, MambaExtend leverages a _**training-free**_ approach to calibrate _only_ the scaling factors of discretization modules for different layers. We demonstrate both gradient-based and gradient-free zeroth-order optimization to learn the optimal scaling factors for each Mamba layer, requiring orders of magnitude fewer updates as opposed to the parameter fine-tuning-based alternatives. \nUsing this approach, we achieve a training-free context extension of up to 32x, expanding the context from 2k to 64k tokens with minimal increases in perplexity. In contrast to existing fine-tuning methods, MambaExtend selectively calibrates the scaling factors, requiring up to $\\mathbf{5.42 * 10^6} \\times$ fewer parameter updates and incurring up to $\\mathbf{3.87} \\times$ lower peak memory usage, while delivering comparable or superior long-context performance across multiple tasks.

{"id": "rvXdGL4pCJ", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) often relies on trial and error, which may cause undesirable outcomes. As a result, standard RL is inappropriate for safety-critical applications. To address this issue, one may train a safe agent in a controlled environment (where safety violations are allowed) and then transfer it to the real world (where safety violations may have disastrous consequences). Prior work has made this transfer safe as long as the new environment preserves the safety-related dynamics. However, in most practical applications, differences or shifts in dynamics between the two environments are inevitable, potentially leading to safety violations after the transfer. This work aims to guarantee safety even when the new environment has different (safety-related) dynamics. In other words, we aim to make the process of safe transfer robust.

Therefore, SYMPOL can become the foundation for a new class of interpretable RL based on decision trees. Our implementation is available under: https://github.com/s-marton/sympol"}

Through these extended training runs, we uncover critical instabilities in FP8 training that were not observable in earlier works with shorter durations. We trace these instabilities to outlier amplification by the SwiGLU activation function. Interestingly, we show, both analytically and empirically, that this amplification happens only over prolonged training periods, and link it to a  SwiGLU weight alignment process. To address this newly identified issue, we introduce Smooth-SwiGLU, a novel modification that ensures stable FP8 training without altering function behavior. We also demonstrate, for the first time, FP8 quantization of both Adam optimizer moments. Combining these innovations, we successfully train a 7B parameter model using FP8 precision on 256 Intel Gaudi2 accelerators, achieving on-par results with the BF16 baseline while delivering up to a $\\sim$ 34 % throughput improvement.

Preference-based feedback, often implemented as a binary comparison between multiple completions, is an established method to acquire large-scale human feedback. However, human feedback in other contexts is often much more diverse. Such diverse feedback can better support the goals of a human annotator, and the simultaneous use of multiple sources might be mutually informative for the learning process or carry type-dependent biases for the reward learning process.\nDespite these potential benefits, learning from different feedback types has yet to be explored extensively.\nIn this paper, we bridge this gap by enabling experimentation and evaluating multi-type feedback in a wide set of environments. We present a process to generate high-quality simulated feedback of six different types. Then, we implement reward models and downstream RL training for all six feedback types.\nBased on the simulated feedback, we investigate the use of types of feedback across ten RL environments and compare them to pure preference-based baselines. We show empirically that diverse types of feedback can be utilized and lead to strong reward modeling performance. This work is the first strong indicator of the potential of multi-type feedback for RLHF."}

{"id": "SOWZ59UyNc", "abstract": "Traditional language model-based theorem proving assumes that by training on a sufficient amount of formal proof data, a model will learn to prove theorems. Our key observation is that a wealth of informal information that is not present in formal proofs can be useful for learning to prove theorems. For instance, humans think through steps of a proof, but this thought process is not visible in the resulting code. We present Lean-STaR, a framework for training language models to produce informal thoughts prior to each step of a proof, thereby boosting the model's theorem-proving capabilities. Lean-STaR uses retrospective ground-truth tactics to generate synthetic thoughts for training the language model. At inference time, the trained model directly generates the thoughts prior to the prediction of the tactics in each proof step. Building on the self-taught reasoner framework, we then apply expert iteration to further fine-tune the model on the correct proofs it samples and verifies using the Lean solver. Lean-STaR significantly outperform base models (43.4% → 46.3%, Pass@64).

{"id": "RavSZTIe2s", "abstract": "Distance field-based implicit representations like signed/unsigned distance fields have recently gained prominence in geometry modeling and analysis. However, these distance fields are reliant on the closest distance of points to the surface, introducing inaccuracies when interpolating along cube edges during surface extraction. Additionally, their gradients are ill-defined at certain locations, causing distortions in the extracted surfaces. To address this limitation, we propose Shape as Line Segments (SALS), an accurate and efficient implicit geometry representation based on attributed line segments, which can handle arbitrary structures. Unlike previous approaches, SALS leverages a differentiable Line Segment Field to implicitly capture the spatial relationship between line segments and the surface. Each line segment is associated with two key attributes, intersection flag and ratio, from which we propose edge-based dual contouring to extract a surface. We further implement SALS with a neural network, producing a new neural implicit presentation. Additionally, based on SALS, we design a novel learning-based pipeline for reconstructing surfaces from 3D point clouds.

{"id": "0yvZm2AjUr", "abstract": "Language models (LMs) are susceptible to bias, sycophancy, backdoors, and other tendencies that lead to unfaithful responses to the input context. Interpreting internal states of LMs could help monitor and correct unfaithful behavior. We hypothesize that LMs faithfully represent their input contexts in a latent world model, and we seek to extract these latent world states as logical propositions. For example, given the input context ``Greg is a nurse. Laura is a physicist.'', we aim to decode the propositions WorksAs(Greg, nurse) and WorksAs(Laura, physicist) from the model's internal activations. To do so we introduce _propositional probes_, which compositionally extract lexical concepts from token activations and bind them into propositions. Key to this is identifying a _binding subspace_ in which bound tokens have high similarity (Greg $\\leftrightarrow$ nurse) but unbound ones do not (Greg $\\not\\leftrightarrow$ physicist). Despite only being trained on linguistically simple English templates, we find that propositional probes generalize to inputs written as short stories and translated to Spanish. Moreover, in three settings where LMs respond unfaithfully to the input context---prompt injections, backdoor attacks, and gender bias--- the decoded propositions remain faithful. This suggests that LMs often encode a faithful world model but decode it unfaithfully, which motivates the search for better interpretability tools for monitoring LMs."}

To account for this distribution drift, time-based train/test splits should be used in evaluation. However, existing academic tabular datasets often lack timestamp metadata to enable such evaluation.\nSecond, a considerable portion of datasets in production settings stem from extensive data acquisition and feature engineering pipelines. This can have an impact on the absolute and relative number of predictive, uninformative, and correlated features compared to academic datasets.\nIn this work, we aim to understand how recent research advances in tabular deep learning transfer to these underrepresented conditions.\nTo this end, we introduce TabReD -- a collection of eight industry-grade tabular datasets. \nWe reassess a large number of tabular ML models and techniques on TabReD. We demonstrate that evaluation on both time-based data splits and richer feature sets leads to different methods ranking, compared to evaluation on random splits and smaller number of features, which are common in academic benchmarks.

In this work, we conjecture that more generally, the SGD solution set is a star domain that contains a star model that is linearly connected to all the other solutions via paths with low loss values, modulo permutations. We propose the Starlight algorithm that finds a star model of a given learning task. We validate our claim by showing that this star model is linearly connected with other independently found solutions. As an additional benefit of our study, we demonstrate better uncertainty estimates on Bayesian Model Averaging over the obtained star domain.

{"id": "VQwI055flA", "abstract": "Recent advancements in neural theorem proving integrate large language models with tree search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), where the language model suggests tactics and the tree search finds the complete proof path. However, many tactics proposed by the language model converge to semantically or strategically similar, reducing diversity and increasing search costs by expanding redundant proof paths. This issue exacerbates as computation scales and more tactics are explored per state. Furthermore, the trained value function suffers from false negatives, label imbalance, and domain gaps due to biased data construction.  To address these challenges, we propose CARTS (diversified tactic CAlibration and bias-Resistant Tree Search), which balances tactic diversity and importance while calibrating model confidence. CARTS also introduce preference modeling and an adjustment term related to the ratio of valid tactics to improve the bias-resistance of the value function. Experimental results demonstrate that CARTS consistently outperforms previous methods achieving a pass@l rate of 49.6\\% on the miniF2F-test benchmark.

{"id": "RoN6NnHjn4", "abstract": "This paper studies how to synthesize face images of non-existent persons, to create a dataset that allows effective training of face recognition (FR) models. Besides generating realistic face images, two other important goals are: 1) the ability to generate a large number of distinct identities (inter-class separation), and 2) a proper variation in appearance of the images for each identity (intra-class variation).\nHowever, existing works 1) are typically limited in how many well-separated identities can be generated and 2) either neglect or use an external model for attribute augmentation. We propose Vec2Face, a holistic model that uses only a sampled vector as input and can flexibly generate and control the identity of face images and their attributes. Composed of a feature masked autoencoder and an image decoder, Vec2Face is supervised by face image reconstruction and can be conveniently used in inference. Using vectors with low similarity among themselves as inputs, Vec2Face generates well-separated identities. Randomly perturbing an input identity vector within a small range allows Vec2Face to generate faces of the same identity with proper variation in face attributes. It is also possible to generate images with designated attributes by adjusting vector values with a gradient descent method. Vec2Face has efficiently synthesized as many as 300K identities, whereas 60K is the largest number of identities created in the previous works.

Our findings indicate that, except for SGD, these algorithms all perform comparably both in their optimal performance and also in terms of how they fare across a wide range of hyperparameter choices. Our results suggest to practitioners that the choice of optimizer can be guided by practical considerations like memory constraints and ease of implementation, as no single algorithm emerged as a clear winner in terms of performance or stability to hyperparameter misspecification. Given our findings, we further dissect these approaches, examining two simplified versions of Adam: a) signed momentum (Signum)  which we see recovers both the performance and hyperparameter stability of Adam and b) Adalayer, a layerwise variant of Adam which we introduce to study the impact on Adam's preconditioning for different layers of the network. Examining Adalayer leads us to the conclusion that, perhaps surprisingly, adaptivity on *both* the last layer and LayerNorm parameters in particular are necessary for retaining performance and stability to learning rate."}

To mitigate the prohibitive costs associated with human evaluations, utilizing a powerful LLM as a judge has emerged as a favored approach. Nevertheless, this methodology encounters several challenges, including substantial expenses, concerns regarding privacy and security, and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose a straightforward, replicable, and accurate automated evaluation method by leveraging a lightweight LLM as the judge, named RocketEval. Initially, we identify that the performance disparity between lightweight and powerful LLMs in evaluation tasks primarily stems from their ability to conduct comprehensive analyses, which is not easily enhanced through techniques such as chain-of-thought reasoning. By reframing the evaluation task as a multi-faceted Q\\&A using an instance-specific checklist, we demonstrate that the limited judgment accuracy of lightweight LLMs is largely attributes to high uncertainty and positional bias. To address these challenges, we introduce an automated evaluation process grounded in checklist grading, which is designed to accommodate a variety of scenarios and questions. This process encompasses the creation of checklists, the grading of these checklists by lightweight LLMs, and the reweighting of checklist items to align with the supervised annotations. Our experiments carried out on the automated evaluation benchmarks, MT-Bench and WildBench datasets, reveal that RocketEval, when using $\\textit{Gemma-2-2B}$ as the judge, achieves a high correlation (0.965) with human preferences, which is comparable to $\\textit{GPT-4o}$.

For automated evaluation with WildBench, we have developed two metrics, WB-Reward and WB-Score, which are computable using advanced LLMs such as GPT-4-turbo. WildBench evaluation uses task-specific checklists to evaluate model outputs systematically and provides structured explanations that justify the scores and comparisons, resulting in more reliable and interpretable automatic judgments. WB-Reward employs fine-grained pairwise comparisons between model responses, generating five potential outcomes: much better, slightly better, slightly worse, much worse, or a tie. Unlike previous evaluations that employed a single baseline model, we selected three baseline models at varying performance levels to ensure a comprehensive pairwise evaluation. Additionally, we propose a simple method to mitigate length bias, by converting outcomes of “slightly better/worse” to “tie” if the winner response exceeds the loser one by more than K characters. WB-Score evaluates the quality of model outputs individually, making it a fast and cost-efficient evaluation metric.

In the first part of this work, we explore using MBR decoding as a method for improving the test-time performance of instruction-following LLMs. We find that MBR decoding with reference-based LLM judges substantially improves over greedy decoding, best-of-N decoding with reference-free judges and MBR decoding with lexical and embedding-based metrics on AlpacaEval and MT-Bench. These gains are consistent across LLMs with up to 70B parameters, demonstrating that smaller LLM judges can be used to supervise much larger LLMs. Then, seeking to retain the improvements from MBR decoding while mitigating additional test-time costs, we explore iterative self-training on MBR-decoded outputs. We find that self-training using Direct Preference Optimisation leads to significant performance gains, such that the self-trained models with greedy decoding generally match and sometimes exceed the performance of their base models with MBR decoding."}

This work addresses this gap by introducing Causal Concept Graph Models (Causal CGMs), a class of interpretable models whose decision-making process is causally transparent by design. Our experiments show that Causal CGMs can: (i) match the generalisation performance of causally opaque models, (ii) enable human-in-the-loop corrections to mispredicted intermediate reasoning steps, boosting not just downstream accuracy after corrections but also the reliability of the explanations provided for specific instances, and (iii) support the analysis of interventional and counterfactual scenarios, thereby improving the model's causal interpretability and supporting the effective verification of its reliability and fairness."}

{"id": "HZVIQE1MsJ", "abstract": "Learning from preference feedback is a common practice for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human value. Conventionally, preference data is learned and encoded into a scalar reward model that connects a value head with an LLM to produce a scalar score as preference. However, scalar models lack interpretability and are known to be susceptible to biases in datasets. This paper investigates leveraging LLM itself to learn from such preference data and serve as a judge to address both limitations in one shot. Specifically, we prompt the pre-trained LLM to generate initial judgment pairs with contrastive preference in natural language form.

{"id": "ZFxpclrCCf", "abstract": "The generation and simulation of diverse real-world scenes have significant application value in the field of autonomous driving, especially for the corner cases. Recently, researchers have explored employing neural radiance fields or diffusion models to generate novel views or synthetic data under driving scenes. However, these approaches suffer from unseen scenes or restricted video length, thus lacking sufficient adaptability for data generation and simulation. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective framework, named Glad, to generate video data in a frame-by-frame style. To ensure the temporal consistency of synthetic video, we introduce a latent variable propagation module, which views the latent features of previous frame as noise prior and injects it into the latent features of current frame. In addition, we design a streaming data sampler to orderly sample the original image in a video clip at continuous iterations. Given the reference frame, our Glad can be viewed as a streaming simulator by generating the videos for specific scenes. Extensive experiments are performed on the widely-used nuScenes dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Glad achieves promising performance, serving as a strong baseline for online video generation. We will release the source code and models publicly."}
{"id": "nDj45w5wam", "abstract": "Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods often suffer from sample-inefficiency, resulting from blind exploration strategies that neglect causal relationships among states, actions, and rewards. Although recent causal approaches aim to address this problem, they lack grounded modeling of reward-guided causal understanding of states and actions for goal-orientation, thus impairing learning efficiency. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel method named Causal Information Prioritization (CIP) that improves sample efficiency by leveraging factored MDPs to infer causal relationships between different dimensions of states and actions with respect to rewards, enabling the prioritization of causal information. Specifically, CIP identifies and leverages causal relationships between states and rewards to execute counterfactual data augmentation to prioritize high-impact state features under the causal understanding of the environments. Moreover, CIP integrates a causality-aware empowerment learning objective, which significantly enhances the agent's execution of reward-guided actions for more efficient exploration in complex environments. \nTo fully assess the effectiveness of CIP, we conduct extensive experiments across $39$ tasks in $5$ diverse continuous control environments, encompassing both locomotion and manipulation skills learning with pixel-based and sparse reward settings. Experimental results demonstrate that CIP consistently outperforms existing RL methods across a wide range of scenarios."}

GCNNs have been designed for a variety of geometric transformations from 2D and 3D rotation groups, to semi-groups such as scale. Despite the improved interpretability, accuracy and generalizability of these architectures, GCNNs have seen limited application in the context of perceptual quantities. Notably, the recent CEConv network uses a GCNN to achieve equivariance to hue transformations by convolving input images with a hue rotated RGB filter. However, this approach leads to invalid RGB values which break equivariance and degrade performance. We resolve these issues with a lifting layer that transforms the input image directly, thereby circumventing the issue of invalid RGB values and improving equivariance error by over three orders of magnitude. Moreover, we extend the notion of color equivariance to include equivariance to saturation and luminance shift. Our hue-, saturation-, luminance- and color-equivariant networks achieve strong generalization to out-of-distribution perceptual variations and improved sample efficiency over conventional architectures. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on synthetic and real world datasets where we consistently outperform competitive baselines."}
{"id": "6jxUsDAdAu", "abstract": "Benign overfitting refers to the phenomenon where an over-parameterized model fits the training data perfectly, including noise in the data, but still generalizes well to the unseen test data. While prior work provides some theoretical understanding of this phenomenon under the in-distribution setup, modern machine learning often operates in a more challenging Out-of-Distribution (OOD) regime, where the target (test) distribution can be rather different from the source (training) distribution. In this work, we take an initial step towards understanding benign overfitting in the OOD regime by focusing on the basic setup of over-parameterized linear models under covariate shift. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees proving that benign overfitting occurs in standard ridge regression, even under the OOD regime when the target covariance satisfies certain structural conditions. We identify several vital quantities relating to source and target covariance, which govern the performance of OOD generalization. Our result is sharp, which provably recovers prior in-distribution benign overfitting guarantee (Tsigler & Bartlett, 2023), as well as under-parameterized OOD guarantee (Ge et al., 2024) when specializing to each setup. Moreover, we also present theoretical results for a more general family of target covariance matrix, where standard ridge regression only achieves a slow statistical rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{n})$ for the excess risk, while Principal Component Regression (PCR) is guaranteed to achieve the fast rate $\\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, where $n$ is the number of samples."}

However, their widespread availability raises concerns about unauthorized usage and copyright infringement, where users or individuals can develop their own LVLMs by fine-tuning published models. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Parameter Learning Attack (PLA) for tracking the copyright of LVLMs without modifying the original model. Specifically, we construct adversarial images through targeted attacks against the original model, enabling it to generate specific outputs. To ensure these attacks remain effective on potential fine-tuned models to trigger copyright tracking, we allow the original model to learn the trigger images by updating parameters in the opposite direction during the adversarial attack process. Notably, the proposed method can be applied after the release of the original model, thus not affecting the model’s performance and behavior. To simulate real-world applications, we fine-tune the original model using various strategies across diverse datasets, creating a range of models for copyright verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can more effectively identify the original copyright of fine-tuned models compared to baseline methods.

{"id": "DJSZGGZYVi", "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that the denoising process in (generative) diffusion models can induce meaningful (discriminative) representations inside the model, though the quality of these representations still lags behind those learned through recent self-supervised learning methods. We argue that one main bottleneck in training large-scale diffusion models for generation lies in effectively learning these representations. Moreover, training can be made easier by incorporating high-quality external visual representations, rather than relying solely on the diffusion models to learn them independently. We study this by introducing a straightforward regularization called REPresentation Alignment (REPA), which aligns the projections of noisy input hidden states in denoising networks with clean image representations obtained from external, pretrained visual encoders. The results are striking: our simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality when applied to popular diffusion and flow-based transformers, such as DiTs and SiTs. For instance, our method can speed up SiT training by over 17.5$\\times$, matching the performance (without classifier-free guidance) of a SiT-XL model trained for 7M steps in less than 400K steps.

{"id": "WOt1owGfuN", "abstract": "We introduce Probe Pruning (PP), a novel framework for online, dynamic, structured pruning of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied in a batch-wise manner. PP leverages the insight that not all samples and tokens contribute equally to the model's output, and probing a small portion of each batch effectively identifies crucial weights, enabling tailored dynamic pruning for different batches. It comprises three main stages: probing, history-informed pruning, and full inference. In the probing stage, PP selects a small yet crucial set of hidden states, based on residual importance, to run a few model layers ahead. During the history-informed pruning stage, PP strategically integrates the probing states with historical states. Subsequently, it structurally prunes weights based on the integrated states and the PP importance score, a metric developed specifically to assess the importance of each weight channel in maintaining performance. In the final stage, full inference is conducted on the remaining weights. A major advantage of PP is its compatibility with existing models, as it operates without requiring additional neural network modules or fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations of PP on LLaMA-2/3 and OPT models reveal that even minimal probing—using just 1.5% of FLOPs—can substantially enhance the efficiency of structured pruning of LLMs. For instance, when evaluated on LLaMA-2-7B with WikiText2, PP achieves a 2.56 times lower ratio of performance degradation per unit of latency reduction compared to the state-of-the-art method at a 40\\% pruning ratio."}
{"id": "6XUSDvBFkV", "abstract": "In this paper, we present the first structural binarization method for LLM compression to less than 1-bit precision. Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, their memory-bound nature during the inference stage hinders the adoption of resource-constrained devices. Reducing weights to 1-bit precision through binarization substantially enhances computational efficiency. We observe that randomly flipping some weights in binarized LLMs does not significantly degrade the model's performance, suggesting the potential for further compression. To exploit this, our STBLLM employs an N:M sparsity technique to achieve structural binarization of the weights. Specifically, we introduce a novel Standardized Importance (SI) metric, which considers weight magnitude and input feature norm to more accurately assess weight significance. Then, we propose a layer-wise approach, allowing different layers of the LLM to be sparsified with varying N:M ratios, thereby balancing compression and accuracy. Furthermore, we implement a fine-grained grouping strategy for less important weights, applying distinct quantization schemes to sparse, intermediate, and dense regions. Finally, we design a specialized CUDA kernel to support structural binarization. We conduct extensive experiments on LLaMA, OPT, and Mistral family. STBLLM achieves a perplexity of 11.07 at 0.55 bits per weight, outperforming the BiLLM by 3×.

This phenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long context generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model quantization, and others.  Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of attention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that attention sinks exist universally in auto-regressive LMs with various inputs, even in small models. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM pre-training, motivating us to investigate how *optimization*, *data distribution*, *loss function*, and *model architecture* in LM pre-training influence its emergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective optimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly correlated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we find that attention sink acts more like key biases, *storing extra attention scores*, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value computation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems from tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax normalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention with other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without normalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters.

Without appropriate constraints, directly training the latest large image models with complex, varied, or in-the-wild data is likely to produce a structure-guided random image generator, rather than achieving the intended goal of precise illumination manipulation. We propose Imposing Consistent Light (IC-Light) transport during training, rooted in the physical principle that the linear blending of an object's appearances under different illumination conditions is consistent with its appearance under mixed illumination. This consistency allows for stable and scalable illumination learning, uniform handling of various data sources, and facilitates a physically grounded model behavior that modifies only the illumination of images while keeping other intrinsic properties unchanged. Based on this method, we can scale up the training of diffusion-based illumination editing models to large data quantities (> 10 million), across all available data types (real light stages, rendered samples, in-the-wild synthetic augmentations, etc), and using strong backbones (SDXL, Flux, etc).

In response to these challenges, we propose LeanQuant (Loss-error-aware network Quantization), a novel quantization method that is accurate, versatile, and scalable. In the existing popular iterative loss-error-based quantization framework, we identify a critical limitation in prior methods: the min-max affine quantization grid fails to preserve model quality due to outliers in inverse Hessian diagonals. To overcome this fundamental issue, we propose learning loss-error-aware grids, instead of using non-adaptive min-max affine grids. Our approach not only produces quantized models that are more accurate but also generalizes to a wider range of quantization types, including affine and non-uniform quantization, enhancing compatibility with more frameworks. Extensive experiments with recent LLMs demonstrate that LeanQuant is highly accurate, comparing favorably against competitive baselines in model quality, and scalable, achieving very accurate quantization of Llama-3.1 405B, one of the largest open-source LLMs to date, using two Quadro RTX 8000-48GB GPUs in 21 hours.

However, this potential is largely unrealized because these assets always need to be converted to meshes for 3D industry applications, and the meshes produced by current mesh extraction methods are significantly inferior to Artist-Created Meshes (AMs), i.e., meshes created by human artists. \n\nSpecifically, current mesh extraction methods rely on dense faces and ignore geometric features, leading to inefficiencies, complicated post-processing, and lower representation quality.\nTo address these issues, we introduce MeshAnything, a model that treats mesh extraction as a generation problem, producing AMs aligned with specified shapes.\n\nBy converting 3D assets in any 3D representation into AMs, MeshAnything can be integrated with various 3D asset production methods, thereby enhancing their application across the 3D industry.\nThe architecture of MeshAnything comprises a VQ-VAE and a shape-conditioned decoder-only transformer. We first learn a mesh vocabulary using the VQ-VAE, then train the shape-conditioned decoder-only transformer on this vocabulary for shape-conditioned autoregressive mesh generation. Our extensive experiments show that our method generates AMs with hundreds of times fewer faces, significantly improving storage, rendering, and simulation efficiencies, while achieving precision comparable to previous methods."}

Various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been devised to mitigate these challenges by training a small set of parameters for the task-specific updates of the model weights. Among PEFT methods, LoRA stands out for its simplicity and efficiency, inspiring the development of a series of variants. However, LoRA and its successors disregard the knowledge that is noisy or irrelevant to the targeted task, detrimentally impacting model performance and leading to suboptimality.

We conduct extensive experiments across a range of LLMs on tasks spanning natural language understanding (NLU), generation (NLG), instruction following, and commonsense reasoning.

In this work, we show that traditional diffusion and flow-matching models with standard Gaussian priors fail to capture heavy-tailed behavior. We address this by repurposing the diffusion framework for heavy-tail estimation using multivariate Student-t distributions. We develop a tailored perturbation kernel and derive the denoising posterior based on the conditional Student-t distribution for the backward process. Inspired by $\\gamma$-divergence for heavy-tailed distributions, we derive a training objective for heavy-tailed denoisers. The resulting framework introduces controllable tail generation using only a single scalar hyperparameter, making it easily tunable for diverse real-world distributions. As specific instantiations of our framework, we introduce t-EDM and t-Flow, extensions of existing diffusion and flow models that employ a Student-t prior. Remarkably, our approach is readily compatible with standard Gaussian diffusion models and requires only minimal code changes. Empirically, we show that our t-EDM and t-Flow outperform standard diffusion models in heavy-tail estimation on high-resolution weather datasets in which generating rare and extreme events is crucial."}

{"id": "8G3FyfHIko", "abstract": "Recent interactive point-based image manipulation methods have gained considerable attention for being user-friendly. However, these methods still face two types of ambiguity issues that can lead to unsatisfactory outcomes, namely, intention ambiguity which misinterprets the purposes of users, and content ambiguity where target image areas are distorted by distracting elements. To address these issues and achieve general-purpose manipulations, we propose a novel task-aware, training-free framework called GDrag. Specifically, GDrag defines a taxonomy of atomic manipulations, which can be parameterized and combined unitedly to represent complex manipulations, thereby reducing intention ambiguity. Furthermore, GDrag introduces two strategies to mitigate content ambiguity, including an anti-ambiguity dense trajectory calculation method (ADT) and a self-adaptive motion supervision method (SMS). Given an atomic manipulation, ADT converts the sparse user-defined handle points into a dense point set by selecting their semantic and geometric neighbors, and calculates the trajectory of the point set. Unlike previous motion supervision methods relying on a single global scale for low-rank adaption, SMS jointly optimizes point-wise adaption scales and latent feature biases. These two methods allow us to model fine-grained target contexts and generate precise trajectories. As a result, GDrag consistently produces precise and appealing results in different editing tasks. Extensive experiments on the challenging DragBench dataset demonstrate that GDrag outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly. The code of GDrag will be released upon acceptance."}

To decrease the complexity in dealing with a large number of semantic classes and patches, we establish a unified framework that calculates the affinity between (semantic and instance) queries and SAM patches, and then merges patches with high affinity to the query.

In this paper, we consider and demonstrate the low-rank properties of gradient and Hessian observed in LLMs training dynamic, and take advantage of such natural properties to design SEPARATE, a simple low-rank projection for gradient compression in modern large-scale model training processes. SEPARATE realizes dimensional reduction by common random Gaussian variables and an improved moving average error-feedback technique.

{"id": "5xmXUwDxep", "abstract": "Diffusion models have demonstrated significant potential for generating high-quality images, audio, and videos. However, their iterative inference process entails substantial computational costs, limiting practical applications. Recently, researchers have introduced accelerated sampling methods that enable diffusion models to generate samples with far fewer timesteps than those used during training. Nonetheless, as the number of sampling steps decreases, the prediction errors significantly degrade the quality of generated outputs. Additionally, the exposure bias in diffusion models further amplifies these errors. To address these challenges, we leverage a manifold hypothesis to explore the exposure bias problem in depth. Based on this geometric perspective, we propose a manifold constraint that effectively reduces exposure bias during accelerated sampling of diffusion models. Notably, our method involves no additional training and requires only minimal hyperparameter tuning.

{"id": "v6iLQBoIJw", "abstract": "Understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks is challenging due to their high-dimensional nature and intricate loss landscapes. Recent studies have revealed that, along the training trajectory, the gradient approximately aligns with a low-rank top eigenspace of the training loss Hessian, referred to as the dominant subspace. Given this alignment, this paper explores whether neural networks can be trained within the dominant subspace, which, if feasible, could lead to more efficient training methods. Our primary observation is that when the SGD update is projected onto the dominant subspace, the training loss does not decrease further.\nThis suggests that the observed alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace is spurious. Surprisingly, projecting out the dominant subspace proves to be just as effective as the original update, despite removing the majority of the original update component. We observe similar behavior across practical setups, including the large learning rate regime (also known as Edge of Stability), Sharpness-Aware Minimization, momentum, and adaptive optimizers. We discuss the main causes and implications of this spurious alignment, shedding light on the dynamics of neural network training."}

Inspired by conjectures about LLMs' behavior from time series forecasting research, we formulate key hypotheses about LLMs' capabilities in time series anomaly detection. We design and conduct principled experiments to test each of these hypotheses. Our investigation reveals several surprising findings about LLMs for time series: (1) LLMs understand time series better as *images* rather than as text, (2) LLMs do not demonstrate enhanced performance when prompted to engage in *explicit reasoning* about time series analysis. (3) Contrary to common beliefs, LLMs' understanding of time series *do not* stem from their repetition biases or arithmetic abilities. (4) LLMs' behaviors and performance in time series analysis *vary significantly* across different models.

We then train on this sequential generating process with the objective of generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to generate both highly rewarded and diverse molecules. To mitigate the large action space of synthetic pathways in GFlowNets, we implement a novel action space subsampling method. This enables RxnFlow to learn generative flows over extensive action spaces comprising combinations of 1.2 million building blocks and 71 reaction templates without significant computational overhead. Additionally, RxnFlow can employ modified or expanded action spaces for generation without retraining, allowing for the introduction of additional objectives or the incorporation of newly discovered building blocks.

{"id": "WLSrq1254E", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on a large amount of corpus, have demonstrated remarkable abilities. However, it may not be sufficient to directly apply open-source LLMs like Llama to certain real-world scenarios, since most of them are trained for \\emph{general} purposes. Thus, the demands for customizing publicly available LLMs emerge, but are currently under-studied. In this work, we consider customizing pre-trained LLMs with new human preferences. Specifically, the LLM should not only meet the new preference but also preserve its original capabilities after customization. Drawing inspiration from the observation that human preference can be expressed as a reward model, we propose to cast LLM customization as optimizing the sum of two reward functions, one of which (denoted as $r_1$) was used to pre-train the LLM while the other (denoted as $r_2$) characterizes the new human preference. The obstacle here is that both reward functions are unknown, making the application of modern reinforcement learning methods infeasible. Thanks to the residual Q-learning framework, we can restore the customized LLM with the pre-trained LLM and the \\emph{residual Q-function} without the reward function $r_1$. Moreover, we find that for a fixed pre-trained LLM, the reward function $r_2$ can be derived from the residual Q-function, enabling us to directly learn the residual Q-function from the new human preference data upon the Bradley-Terry model. We name our method Q-Adapter as it introduces an adapter module to approximate the residual Q-function for customizing the pre-trained LLM towards the new preference.

The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms the hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem.

In this paper, we theoretically analyze the quality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach to improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically. Specifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and our gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and random directions, in a query-efficient manner. We theoretically derive the expected cosine similarities between the obtained gradient estimators and the true gradient, and demonstrate the improvement achieved by incorporating priors.

We empirically verify a scaling law where the maximum number of target tokens predicted, $t_\\mathrm{max}$, depends linearly on the number of tokens $a$ whose activations the attacker controls as $t_\\mathrm{max} = \\kappa a$. We find that the number of bits the attacker controls on the input to exert a single bit of control on the output (a property we call \\textit{attack resistance $\\chi$}) is remarkably stable between $\\approx 16$ and $\\approx 25$ over orders of magnitude of model sizes and between model families. Compared to attacks directly on input tokens, attacks on activations are predictably much stronger, however, we identify a surprising regularity where one bit of input steered either via activations or via tokens is able to exert a surprisingly similar amount of control over the model predictions. This gives support for the hypothesis that adversarial attacks are a consequence of dimensionality mismatch between the input and output spaces. A practical implication of the ease of attacking language model activations instead of tokens is for multi-modal and selected retrieval models.

{"id": "wJv4AIt4sK", "abstract": "The increasing size of deep neural networks (DNNs) necessitates effective model compression to reduce their computational and memory footprints. Sparsity and quantization are two prominent compression methods that have been shown to reduce DNNs' computational and memory footprints significantly while preserving model accuracy. However, how these two methods interact when combined together remains a key question for developers, as many tacitly assume that they are orthogonal, meaning that their combined use does not introduce additional errors beyond those introduced by each method independently. In this paper, we provide the first mathematical proof that sparsity and quantization are non-orthogonal. We corroborate these results with experiments spanning a range of large language models, including the OPT and LLaMA model families (with 125M to 8B parameters), and vision models like ViT and ResNet. We show that the order in which we apply these methods matters because applying quantization before sparsity may disrupt the relative importance of tensor elements, which may inadvertently remove significant elements from a tensor. More importantly, we show that even if applied in the correct order, the compounded errors from sparsity and quantization can significantly harm accuracy. Our findings extend to the efficient deployment of large models in resource-constrained compute platforms to reduce serving cost, offering insights into best practices for applying these compression methods to maximize hardware resource efficiency without compromising accuracy."}

ULTRAINTERACT allows us to conduct an in-depth exploration of preference learning for reasoning tasks. Our investigation reveals that some well-established preference learning algorithms may be less suitable for reasoning tasks compared to their effectiveness in general conversations. The hypothesis is that in reasoning tasks, the space of correct answers is much smaller than that of incorrect ones, so it is necessary to explicitly increase the reward of chosen data. Therefore, in addition to increasing the reward margin as many preference learning algorithms do, the absolute values of positive responses’ rewards should be positive and may serve as a proxy for performance. Inspired by this, we derive a novel reward modeling objective and empirically that it leads to a stable reward modeling curve and better performance. Together with ULTRAINTERACT, we obtain a strong reward model."}
{"id": "Tkkrm3pA35", "abstract": "Preconditioning is at the heart of iterative solutions of large, sparse linear systems of equations in scientific disciplines. Several algebraic approaches, which access no information beyond the matrix itself, are widely studied and used, but ill-conditioned matrices remain very challenging. We take a machine learning approach and propose using graph neural networks as a general-purpose preconditioner. They show attractive performance for many problems and can be used when the mainstream preconditioners perform poorly. Empirical evaluation on over 800 matrices suggests that the construction time of these graph neural preconditioners (GNPs) is more predictable and can be much shorter than that of other widely used ones, such as ILU and AMG, while the execution time is faster than using a Krylov method as the preconditioner, such as in inner-outer GMRES. GNPs have a strong potential for solving large-scale, challenging algebraic problems arising from not only partial differential equations, but also economics, statistics, graph, and optimization, to name a few."}
{"id": "HE6pJoNnFp", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval exhibit robust performance and extensive versatility by incorporating external contexts. However, the input length grows linearly in the number of retrieved documents, causing a dramatic increase in latency. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm named Sparse RAG, which seeks to cut computation costs through sparsity. Speciﬁcally, Sparse RAG encodes retrieved documents in parallel, which eliminates latency introduced by long-range attention of retrieved documents. Then, LLMs selectively decode the output by only attending to highly relevant caches auto-regressively, which are chosen via prompting LLMs with special control tokens. It is notable that Sparse RAG combines the assessment of each individual document and the generation of the response into a single process. The designed sparse mechanism in a RAG system can facilitate the reduction of the number of documents loaded during decoding for accelerating the inference of the RAG system. Additionally, ﬁltering out undesirable contexts enhances the model’s focus on relevant context, inherently improving its generation quality. Evaluation results on four datasets show that Sparse RAG can be used to strike an optimal balance between generation quality and computational efﬁciency, demonstrating its generalizability across tasks."}
{"id": "FSjIrOm1vz", "abstract": "The scaling of inference computation has unlocked the potential of long-context large language models (LLMs) across diverse settings. For knowledge-intensive tasks, the increased compute is often allocated to incorporate more external knowledge.  However, without effectively utilizing such knowledge, solely expanding context does not always enhance performance. In this work, we investigate inference scaling for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), exploring the combination of multiple strategies beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge, including in-context learning and iterative prompting. These strategies provide additional flexibility to scale test-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or generation steps), thereby enhancing LLMs’ ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information. We address two key questions: (1) How does RAG performance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally configured? (2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters? Our observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a relationship we describe as the inference scaling laws for RAG. Building on this,  we further develop the computation allocation model to estimate RAG performance across different inference configurations.  The model predicts optimal inference parameters under various computation constraints, which align closely with the experimental results. By applying these optimal configurations, we demonstrate that scaling inference compute on long-context LLMs achieves up to 58.9% gains on benchmark datasets compared to standard RAG."}

Yet, besides reducing the training and rendering complexity, applying inverse graphics in the latent space enables a valuable interoperability with other latent-based 2D methods. The major challenge is that inverse graphics cannot be directly applied to such image latent spaces because they lack an underlying 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose an Inverse Graphics Autoencoder (IG-AE) that specifically addresses this issue. To this end, we regularize an image autoencoder with 3D-geometry by aligning its latent space with jointly trained latent 3D scenes. We utilize the trained IG-AE to bring NeRFs to the latent space with a latent NeRF training pipeline, which we implement in an open-source extension of the Nerfstudio framework, thereby unlocking latent scene learning for its supported methods.

Typically, in MOO for neural architecture search (NAS), we aim to balance performance and hardware metrics across devices. Prior NAS approaches simplify this task by incorporating hardware constraints into the objective function, but profiling the Pareto front necessitates a computationally expensive search for each constraint. In this work, we propose a novel NAS algorithm that encodes user preferences to trade-off performance and hardware metrics, yielding representative and diverse architectures across multiple devices in just a single search run. To this end, we parameterize the joint architectural distribution across devices and multiple objectives via a hypernetwork that can be conditioned on hardware features and preference vectors, enabling zero-shot transferability to new devices. Extensive experiments involving up to 19 hardware devices and 3 different objectives demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method.

{"id": "armbJRJdrH", "abstract": "Robustness is essential for deep neural networks, especially in security-sensitive applications. To this end, randomized smoothing provides theoretical guarantees for certifying robustness against adversarial perturbations. Recently, diffusion models have been successfully employed for randomized smoothing to purify noise-perturbed samples before making predictions with a standard classifier. While these methods excel at small perturbation radii, they struggle with larger perturbations and incur a significant computational overhead during inference compared to classical methods. To address this, we reformulate the generative modeling task along the diffusion trajectories in pixel space as a discriminative task in the latent space. Specifically, we use instance discrimination to achieve consistent representations along the trajectories by aligning temporally adjacent points. After fine-tuning based on the learned representations, our model enables implicit denoising-then-classification via a single prediction, substantially reducing inference costs. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computation budget during inference. For example, our method outperforms the certified accuracy of diffusion-based methods on ImageNet across all perturbation radii by 5.3\\% on average, with up to 11.6\\% at larger radii, while reducing inference costs by 85x on average."}

Our approach harnesses the strengths of conformal methods—modularity, model-agnosticism, and statistical coverage guarantees—while incorporating downstream decisions and user-specified utility functions. We prove that our methods retain standard coverage guarantees.  Empirical evaluation across a range of datasets and utility metrics demonstrates that our methods achieve significantly lower decision loss compared to standard conformal methods.

To address sycophancy in LLMs, we analyze and model the problem through the lens of structured causal models (SCMs). We attribute sycophancy to LLMs' reliance on spurious correlations between user preferences and model outputs in this paper. Based on the proposed SCMs, we develop a novel framework, termed **CAUSM**, to mitigate sycophancy in LLMs by exploiting a significant causal signature. Specifically, we eliminate the spurious correlations embedded in the intermediate layers of LLMs through causally motivated head reweighting, and then calibrate the intra-head knowledge along the causal representation direction. Extensive experiments are conducted across diverse language tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art competitors in mitigating sycophancy in LLMs."}

{"id": "tZdqL5FH7w", "abstract": "Concept erasure has emerged as a promising technique for mitigating the risk of harmful content generation in diffusion models by selectively unlearning undesirable concepts. The common principle of previous works to remove a specific concept is to map it to a fixed generic concept, such as a neutral concept or just an empty text prompt. In this paper, we demonstrate that this fixed-target strategy is suboptimal, as it fails to account for the impact of erasing one concept on the others. To address this limitation, we model the concept space as a graph and empirically analyze the effects of erasing one concept on the remaining concepts. Our analysis uncovers intriguing geometric properties of the concept space, where the influence of erasing a concept is confined to a local region. Building on this insight, we propose the Adaptive Guided Erasure (AGE) method, which dynamically selects optimal target concepts tailored to each undesirable concept, minimizing unintended side effects.

We introduce AHA, an open-source VLM designed to detect and reason about failures in robotic manipulation using natural language. By framing failure detection as a free-form reasoning task, AHA identifies failures and provides detailed, adaptable explanations across different robots, tasks, and environments. We fine-tuned AHA using FailGen, a scalable framework that generates the first large-scale dataset of robotic failure trajectories, the AHA dataset.

This limitation makes the pre-training task overly simplistic, preventing the models from capturing richer molecular semantic information. Moreover, during pre-training, these SMILES LMs only process corrupted SMILES inputs, never encountering any valid SMILES, which leads to a train-inference mismatch. To address these challenges, we propose SMI-Editor, a novel edit-based pre-trained SMILES LM.

{"id": "kbm6tsICar", "abstract": "Data-driven modeling of dynamical systems is a crucial area of machine learning. In many scenarios, a thorough understanding of the model’s behavior becomes essential for practical applications. For instance, understanding the behavior of a pharmacokinetic model, constructed as part of drug development, may allow us to both verify its biological plausibility (e.g., the drug concentration curve is non-negative and decays to zero in the long term) and to design dosing guidelines (e.g., by looking at the peak concentration and its timing). Discovery of closed-form ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be employed to obtain such insights by finding a compact mathematical equation and then analyzing it (a two-step approach). However, its widespread use is currently hindered because the analysis process may be time-consuming, requiring substantial mathematical expertise, or even impossible if the equation is too complex. Moreover, if the found equation's behavior does not satisfy the requirements, editing it or influencing the discovery algorithms to rectify it is challenging as the link between the symbolic form of an ODE and its behavior can be elusive. This paper proposes a conceptual shift to modeling low-dimensional dynamical systems by departing from the traditional two-step modeling process. Instead of first discovering a closed-form equation and then analyzing it, our approach, direct semantic modeling, predicts the semantic representation of the dynamical system (i.e., description of its behavior) directly from data, bypassing the need for complex post-hoc analysis. This direct approach also allows the incorporation of intuitive inductive biases into the optimization algorithm and editing the model's behavior directly, ensuring that the model meets the desired specifications. Our approach not only simplifies the modeling pipeline but also enhances the transparency and flexibility of the resulting models compared to traditional closed-form ODEs."}

A well-known problem encountered in this setting is the so-called catastrophic forgetting, for which the learning model is inclined to focus on more recent tasks while forgetting the previously learned knowledge. The majority of the current approaches in FCL propose generative-based solutions to solve said problem. However, this setting requires multiple training epochs over the data, implying an offline setting where datasets are stored locally and remain unchanged over time. Furthermore, the proposed solutions are tailored for vision tasks solely. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach to deal with different modalities in the online scenario where new data arrive in streams of mini-batches that can only be processed once. To solve catastrophic forgetting, we propose an uncertainty-aware memory-based approach.  Specifically, we suggest using an estimator based on the Bregman Information (BI) to compute the model's variance at the sample level. Through measures of predictive uncertainty, we retrieve samples with specific characteristics, and – by retraining the model on such samples – we demonstrate the potential of this approach to reduce the forgetting effect in realistic settings while maintaining data confidentiality and competitive communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches."}

However, when the downstream tasks are constrained by limited image-text paired data, CLIP struggles to effectively address the domain gap between the pre-training and the target tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel semi-supervised CLIP training method coined SemiCLIP that leverages a small amount of image-text pairs alongside a large volume of images without text descriptions to enhance CLIP’s cross-modal alignment. To effectively utilize unlabeled images, we introduce semantic concept mining to improve task-specific visual representations by matching images with relevant concepts mined from labeled data. Leveraging matched semantic concepts, we construct learnable surrogate captions for unlabeled images and optimize a trapezoidal consistency to regulate the geometric structure of image-text pairs in the representation space. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the adaptability of CLIP in target tasks with limited labeled data, achieving gains ranging from 1.72\\% -- 6.58\\% for zero-shot classification accuracy and 2.32\\% -- 3.23\\% for image-text retrieval performance on standard benchmarks.

Such EEG-based model trained on fixed datasets cannot generalize well to the continual flow of numerous unseen subjects in real-world scenarios. This limitation can be addressed through continual learning (CL), wherein the CL model can continuously learn and advance over time. Inspired by CL, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Individual Continual Learning paradigm for handling this issue in practice. We propose the BrainUICL framework, which enables the EEG-based model to continuously adapt to the incoming new subjects. Simultaneously, BrainUICL helps the model absorb new knowledge during each adaptation, thereby advancing its generalization ability for all unseen subjects. The effectiveness of the proposed BrainUICL has been evaluated on three different mainstream EEG tasks. The BrainUICL can effectively balance both the plasticity and stability during CL, achieving better plasticity on new individuals and better stability across all the unseen individuals, which holds significance in a practical  setting."}

During each iteration of MTT, random time steps are assigned to different SNN stages, with spikes transmitted between stages via communication modules. After training, the weights are deployed and evaluated on both time-stepped and fully event-driven platforms. Experimental results show that models trained by MTT gain remarkable temporal flexibility, friendliness for both event-driven and clock-driven deployment (nearly lossless on N-MNIST and 10.1\\% higher than standard methods on CIFAR10-DVS), enhanced network generalization, and near SOTA performance.

However, manual annotation of such data is often time-consuming and costly. Recent methods often adopt a self-rewarding approach, where the target model generates and annotates its own preference data, but this can lead to inaccuracies since the reward model shares weights with the target model, thereby amplifying inherent biases. To address these issues, we propose Anyprefer, a framework designed to synthesize high-quality preference data for aligning the target model. Anyprefer frames the data synthesis process as a cooperative two-player Markov Game, where the target model and the judge model collaborate together.

In practice however, the typical goal of maximizing total reward may be less important than minimizing the total cost of the decisions taken, subject to a reward constraint. For example, we may seek to make decisions that have at least the reward of a reference ``default'' decision, with as low a cost as possible. This problem was recently introduced in the Multi-Armed Bandits with Cost Subsidy (MAB-CS) framework. MAB-CS is broadly applicable to problem domains where a primary metric (cost) is constrained by a secondary metric (reward), and the rewards are unknown. In our work, we address variants of MAB-CS including ones with reward constrained by the reward of a known reference arm or by the subsidized best reward. We introduce the Pairwise-Elimination (PE) algorithm for the known reference arm variant and generalize PE to PE-CS for the subsidized best reward variant. Our instance-dependent analysis of PE and PE-CS reveals that both algorithms have an order-wise logarithmic upper bound on Cost and Quality Regret, making our policies the first with such a guarantee. Moreover, by comparing our upper and lower bound results we establish that PE is order-optimal for all known reference arm problem instances.

To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the *optimal* estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks."}

One unique challenge in this field is catastrophic unlearning, where erasing specific data from a well-trained model unintentionally removes essential knowledge, causing the model to deviate significantly from a retrained one. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that regularizes the unlearning process by utilizing synthesized mixup samples, which simulate the data susceptible to catastrophic effects. At the core of our approach is a generator-unlearner framework, MixUnlearn, where a generator adversarially produces challenging mixup examples, and the unlearner effectively forgets target information based on these synthesized data. Specifically, we first introduce a novel contrastive objective to train the generator in an adversarial direction: generating examples that prompt the unlearner to reveal information that should be forgotten, while losing essential knowledge. Then the unlearner, guided by two other contrastive loss terms, processes the synthesized and real data jointly to ensure accurate unlearning without losing critical knowledge, overcoming catastrophic effects. Extensive evaluations across benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, offering a robust solution to machine unlearning.

SGUL overcomes key limitations of existing methods, including poor generalization to unseen test-time structures and indirect optimization. Experiments on diverse graph datasets demonstrate that SGUL consistently outperforms existing baselines in both inductive and transductive settings. SGUL offers an effective, efficient, and interpretable approach for quantifying the value of test-time neighbors."}
{"id": "VOoJEQlLW5", "abstract": "The effectiveness of statistical and machine learning methods depends on how well data features are characterized. Developing informative and interpretable latent representations with controlled complexity is essential for visualizing data structure and for facilitating efficient model building through dimensionality reduction. Latent variable models, such as Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GP-LVM), have become popular for learning complex, nonlinear representations as alternatives to Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In this paper, we propose a novel class of latent variable models based on the recently introduced Q-exponential process (QEP), which generalizes GP-LVM with a tunable complexity parameter, $q>0$. Our approach, the \\emph{Q-exponential Process Latent Variable Model (QEP-LVM)}, subsumes GP-LVM as a special case when $q=2$, offering greater flexibility in managing representation complexity while enhancing interpretability. To ensure scalability, we incorporate sparse variational inference within a Bayesian training framework. We establish connections between QEP-LVM and probabilistic PCA, demonstrating its superior performance through experiments on datasets such as the Swiss roll, oil flow, and handwritten digits."}

To illustrate our method, we introduce Tell Me A Story, a high-quality dataset of complex writing prompts and human-written stories, and a novel evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing long narratives. We show that Agents' Room generates stories that are preferred by expert evaluators over those produced by baseline systems by leveraging collaboration and specialization to decompose the complex story writing task into tractable components.

{"id": "z2z9suDRjw", "abstract": "Machine Learning-based heuristics have recently shown impressive performance in solving a variety of hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However they generally rely on a separate neural model, specialized and trained for each single problem. Any variation of a problem requires adjustment of its model and re-training from scratch. In this paper, we propose GOAL (for Generalist combinatorial Optimization Agent Learner), a generalist model capable of efficiently solving multiple COPs and which can be fine-tuned to solve new COPs. GOAL consists of a single backbone plus light-weight problem-specific adapters for input and output processing. The backbone is based on a new form of mixed-attention blocks which allows to handle problems defined on graphs with arbitrary combinations of node, edge and instance-level features. Additionally, problems which involve heterogeneous types of nodes or edges are handled through a novel multi-type transformer architecture, where the attention blocks are duplicated to attend the meaningful combinations of types while relying on the same shared parameters. We train GOAL on a set of routing, scheduling and classic graph problems and show that it is only slightly inferior to the specialized baselines while being the first multi-task model that solves a wide range of COPs. Finally we showcase the strong transfer learning capacity of GOAL by fine-tuning it on several new problems. Our code is available at https://github.com/naver/goal-co ."}
{"id": "wMgr7wBuUo", "abstract": "In the primate neocortex, neurons with similar function are often found to be spatially close. Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) has been one of the most influential approaches for simulating brain-like topographical organization in artificial neural network models. However, integrating these maps into deep neural networks with multitude of layers has been challenging, with self-organized deep neural networks suffering from substantially diminished capacity to perform visual recognition. We identified a key factor leading to the performance degradation in self-organized topographical neural network models: the discord between predominantly bottom-up learning updates in the self-organizing maps, and those derived from top-down, credit-based learning approaches. To address this, we propose an alternative self organization algorithm, tailored to align with the top-down learning processes in deep neural networks. This model not only emulates critical aspects of cortical topography but also significantly narrows the performance gap between non-topographical and topographical models. This advancement underscores the substantial importance of top-down assigned credits in shaping topographical organization. Our findings are a step in reconciling topographical modeling with the functional efficacy of neural network models, paving the way for more brain-like neural architectures."}
{"id": "imT03YXlG2", "abstract": "Adapting foundation models for specific purposes has become a standard approach to build machine learning systems for downstream applications. Yet, it is an open question which mechanisms take place during adaptation. Here we develop a new Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) for the CLIP vision transformer, named PatchSAE, to extract interpretable concepts at granular levels (e.g., shape, color, or semantics of an object) and their patch-wise spatial attributions. We explore how these concepts influence the model output in downstream image classification tasks and investigate how recent state-of-the-art prompt-based adaptation techniques change the association of model inputs to these concepts. While activations of concepts slightly change between adapted and non-adapted models, we find that the majority of gains on common adaptation tasks can be explained with the existing concepts already present in the non-adapted foundation model. This work provides a concrete framework to train and use SAEs for Vision Transformers and provides insights into explaining adaptation mechanisms."}
{"id": "Essg9kb4yx", "abstract": "While large language models have demonstrated impressive performance across various domains and tasks, their security issues have become increasingly severe. Machine unlearning has emerged as a representative approach for model safety and security by removing the influence of undesired data on the target model. \nHowever, these methods do not sufficiently consider that unlearning requests in real-world scenarios are continuously emerging, especially in the context of LLMs, which may lead to accumulated model utility loss that eventually becomes unacceptable.\nMoreover, existing LLM unlearning methods often ignore previous data access limitations due to privacy concerns and copyright protection. Without previous data, the utility preservation during unlearning is much harder.  \nTo overcome these challenges, we propose the \\OOO{} framework that includes an \\underline{\\textit{O}}rthogonal low-rank adapter (LoRA) for continually unlearning requested data and an \\underline{\\textit{O}}ut-\\underline{\\textit{O}}f-Distribution (OOD) detector to measure the similarity between input and unlearning data. The orthogonal LoRA achieves parameter disentanglement among continual unlearning requests. The OOD detector is trained with a novel contrastive entropy loss and utilizes a glocal-aware scoring mechanism. During inference, our \\OOO{} framework can decide whether and to what extent to load the unlearning LoRA based on the OOD detector's predicted similarity between the input and the unlearned knowledge. Notably, \\OOO{}'s effectiveness does not rely on any retained data. We conducted extensive experiments on \\OOO{} and state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods across three tasks and seven datasets. The results indicate that \\OOO{} consistently achieves the best unlearning effectiveness and utility preservation, especially when facing continuous unlearning requests.

{"id": "62Ff8LDAJZ", "abstract": "Learning generative models of 3D point clouds is one of the fundamental problems in 3D generative learning. One of the key properties of point clouds is their permutation invariance, i.e., changing the order of points in a point cloud does not change the shape they represent. In this paper, we analyze the recently proposed equivariant OT flows that learn permutation invariant generative models for point-based molecular data and we show that these models scale poorly on large point clouds. Also, we observe learning (equivariant) OT flows is generally challenging since straightening flow trajectories makes the learned flow model complex at the beginning of the trajectory. To remedy these, we propose not-so-optimal transport flow models that obtain an approximate OT by an offline OT precomputation, enabling an efficient construction of OT pairs for training. During training, we can additionally construct a hybrid coupling by combining our approximate OT and independent coupling to make the target flow models easier to learn. In an extensive empirical study, we show that our proposed model outperforms prior diffusion- and flow -based approaches on a wide range of unconditional generation and shape completion on the ShapeNet benchmark."}
{"id": "stK7iOPH9Q", "abstract": "Leveraging the visual priors of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models offers a promising solution to enhance zero-shot generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, existing methods often uncritically use the original diffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamental differences between dense prediction and image generation. In this paper, we provide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense prediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that the original parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict noise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising diffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based on these insights, we introduce $\\textbf{Lotus}$, a diffusion-based visual foundation model with a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction. Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of noise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusion process into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and significantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or model capacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation across various datasets. It also enhances efficiency, being significantly faster than most existing diffusion-based methods. Lotus' superior quality and efficiency also enable a wide range of practical applications, such as joint estimation, single/multi-view 3D reconstruction, etc."}
{"id": "YK9G4Htdew", "abstract": "The DreamerV3 algorithm recently obtained remarkable performance across diverse environment domains by learning an accurate world model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Following the success of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms and the rapid adoption of the Transformer architecture for its superior training efficiency and favorable scaling properties, recent works such as STORM have proposed replacing RNN-based world models with Transformer-based world models using masked self-attention. However, despite the improved training efficiency of these methods, their impact on performance remains limited compared to the Dreamer algorithm, struggling to learn competitive Transformer-based world models. In this work, we show that the next state prediction objective adopted in previous approaches is insufficient to fully exploit the representation capabilities of Transformers. We propose to extend world model predictions to longer time horizons by introducing TWISTER (Transformer-based World model wIth contraSTivE Representations), a world model using action-conditioned Contrastive Predictive Coding to learn high-level temporal feature representations and improve the agent performance.

{"id": "Ze4aPP0tIn", "abstract": "Augmenting the multi-step reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a persistent challenge. Recently, verification has shown promise in improving solution consistency by evaluating generated outputs. However, current verification approaches suffer from sampling inefficiencies, requiring a large number of samples to achieve satisfactory performance. Additionally, training an effective verifier often depends on extensive process supervision, which is costly to acquire. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a novel verification method based on Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (TSMC). TSMC sequentially refines its sampling effort to focus exploration on promising candidates, resulting in more efficient generation of high-quality solutions. We apply TSMC to LLMs by estimating the expected future rewards at partial solutions. This approach results in a more straightforward training target that eliminates the need for step-wise human annotations. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our method across multiple math benchmarks, and also validate our theoretical analysis of both our approach and existing verification methods."}

Usually, they treat the spherical weather data as planar images, resulting in an inaccurate representation of locations and spatial relations. In this work, we propose the geometric-inspired Circular Transformer (CirT) to model the cyclic characteristic of the graticule, consisting of two key designs: (1) Decomposing the weather data by latitude into circular patches that serve as input tokens to the Transformer; (2) Leveraging Fourier transform in self-attention to capture the global information and model the spatial periodicity. Extensive experiments on the Earth Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) reanalysis dataset demonstrate our model yields a significant improvement over the advanced data-driven models, including PanguWeather and GraphCast, as well as skillful ECMWF systems.

{"id": "scKAXgonmq", "abstract": "Conventional 2D pose estimation models are constrained by their design to specific object categories. This limits their applicability to predefined objects. To overcome these limitations, category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) emerged as a solution. CAPE aims to facilitate keypoint localization for diverse object categories using a unified model, which can generalize from minimal annotated support images.\nRecent CAPE works have produced object poses based on arbitrary keypoint definitions annotated on a user-provided support image. Our work departs from conventional CAPE methods, which require a support image, by adopting a text-based approach instead of the support image. \nSpecifically, we use a pose-graph, where nodes represent keypoints that are described with text. This representation takes advantage of the abstraction of text descriptions and the structure imposed by the graph.\nOur approach effectively breaks symmetry, preserves structure, and improves occlusion handling.\nWe validate our novel approach using the MP-100 benchmark, a comprehensive dataset covering over 100 categories and 18,000 images. MP-100 is structured so that the evaluation categories are unseen during training, making it especially suited for CAPE.  Under a 1-shot setting, our solution achieves a notable performance boost of 1.26\\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art for CAPE. Additionally, we enhance the dataset by providing text description annotations for both training and testing. We also include alternative text annotations specifically for testing the model's ability to generalize across different textual descriptions, further increasing its value for future research.

While many NAS methods still require training of (some) neural networks, zero-cost proxies promise to identify the optimal network without training. In this work, we propose the zero-cost proxy Network Expressivity by Activation Rank (NEAR). It is based on the effective rank of the pre- and post-activation matrix, i.e., the values of a neural network layer before and after applying its activation function. We demonstrate the cutting-edge correlation between this network score and the model accuracy on NAS-Bench-101 and NATS-Bench-SSS/TSS.

{"id": "wm5wwAdiEt", "abstract": "Effective communication is an essential component in collaborative multi-agent systems. Situations where explicit messaging is not feasible have been common in human society throughout history, which motivate the study of implicit communication.

However, ToM-based methods become less effective in making accurate inferences in complex tasks. In this work, we propose the Implicit Channel Protocol (ICP) framework, which allows agents to communicate through implicit communication channels similar to the explicit ones. ICP leverages a subset of actions, denoted as the scouting actions, and a mapping between information and these scouting actions that encodes and decodes the messages. We propose training algorithms for agents to message and act, including learning with a randomly initialized information map and with a delayed information map.

{"id": "UvTo3tVBk2", "abstract": "Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (LRNNs) such as Mamba, RWKV, GLA, mLSTM, and DeltaNet have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for long sequences. However, both Transformers and LRNNs struggle to perform state-tracking, which may impair performance in tasks such as code evaluation. In one forward pass, current architectures are unable to solve even parity, the simplest state-tracking task, which non-linear RNNs can handle effectively. Recently, Sarrof et al. (2024) demonstrated that the failure of LRNNs like Mamba to solve parity stems from restricting the value range of their diagonal state-transition matrices to $[0, 1]$ and that incorporating negative values can resolve this issue. We extend this result to non-diagonal LRNNs such as DeltaNet. We prove that finite precision LRNNs with state-transition matrices having only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity, while non-triangular matrices are needed to count modulo $3$. Notably, we also prove that LRNNs can learn any regular language when their state-transition matrices are products of identity minus vector outer product matrices, each with eigenvalues in the range $[-1, 1]$. Our experiments confirm that extending the eigenvalue range of Mamba and DeltaNet to include negative values not only enables them to solve parity but consistently improves their performance on state-tracking tasks. We also show that state-tracking enabled LRNNs can be pretrained  stably and efficiently at scale (1.3B parameters), achieving competitive performance on language modeling and showing promise on code and math tasks."}
{"id": "B9kUJuWrYC", "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in federated learning (FL), the integration of generative models into FL has been limited due to challenges such as high communication costs and unstable training in heterogeneous data environments. To address these issues, we propose PRISM, a FL framework tailored for generative models that ensures (i) stable performance in heterogeneous data distributions and (ii) resource efficiency in terms of communication cost and final model size. The key of our method is to search for an optimal stochastic binary mask for a random network rather than updating the model weights, identifying a sparse subnetwork with high generative performance; i.e., a ``strong lottery ticket''. By communicating binary masks in a stochastic manner, PRISM minimizes communication overhead. This approach, combined with the utilization of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss and a mask-aware dynamic moving average aggregation method (MADA) on the server side, facilitates stable and strong generative capabilities by mitigating local divergence in FL scenarios. Moreover, thanks to its sparsifying characteristic, PRISM yields a lightweight model without extra pruning or quantization, making it ideal for environments such as edge devices. Experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR10 demonstrate that PRISM outperforms existing methods, while maintaining privacy with minimal communication costs. PRISM is the first to successfully generate images under challenging non-IID and privacy-preserving FL environments on complex datasets, where previous methods have struggled."}

We introduce the first Bayesian regret lower bounds that depend on the information an agent accumulates. We also prove regret upper bounds using the amount of information the agent accumulates.

Second, while the conventional use of TWD is to speed up the computation of the Wasserstein distance, we use its inherent tree as a means to learn the latent feature hierarchy. The key idea of our method is to embed the features into a multi-scale hyperbolic space using diffusion geometry and then present a new tree decoding method by establishing analogies between the hyperbolic embedding and trees. We show that our TWD computed based on data observations provably recovers the TWD defined with the latent feature hierarchy and that its computation is efficient and scalable.

{"id": "v1B4aet9ct", "abstract": "Estimating matrices in the symmetric positive-definite (SPD) cone is of interest for many applications ranging from computer vision to graph learning. While there exist various convex optimization-based estimators, they remain limited in expressivity due to their model-based approach. The success of deep learning motivates the use of learning-based approaches to estimate SPD matrices with neural networks in a data-driven fashion. However, designing effective neural architectures for SPD learning is challenging, particularly when the task requires\nadditional structural constraints, such as element-wise sparsity. Current approaches either do not ensure that the output meets all desired properties or lack expressivity. In this paper, we introduce SpodNet, a novel and generic learning module that guarantees SPD outputs and supports additional structural constraints.

{"id": "0fJfVOSUra", "abstract": "The challenge of mapping AI architectures to GPU hardware is creating a critical bottleneck in AI progress. Despite substantial efforts, hand-written custom kernels fail to meet their theoretical performance thresholds, even on well-established operations like linear attention. The diverse capabilities of GPUs suggests we might we need a wide variety of techniques to achieve high performance. However, our work explores if a small number of key abstractions can drastically simplify the process. We present ThunderKittens (TK), a framework for writing performant AI kernels while remaining easy to use. Our abstractions map to the three levels of the GPU hierarchy: (1) at the warp-level, we provide 16x16 matrix tiles as basic data structures and PyTorch-like operations, (2) at the thread-block level, we provide templates for asynchronously overlapping operations, and (3) at the grid-level, TK helps hide block launch, tear-down, and memory costs. We show the value of TK by providing simple & diverse kernels that match or outperform prior art. We match CuBLAS and FlashAttention-3 on GEMM and attention inference performance and outperform the strongest baselines by $10-40$\\% on attention backwards, $8\\times$ on state space models, and $14\\times$ on linear attention."}
{"id": "rGP2jbWt0l", "abstract": "Attribution algorithms explain computer vision models by attributing the model response to pixels within the input. Existing attribution methods generate explanations by combining transformations of internal model representations such as class activation maps, gradients, attention, or relevance scores. The effectiveness of an attribution map is measured using attribution quality metrics. This leads us to pose the following question: if attribution methods are assessed using attribution quality metrics, why are the metrics not used to generate the attributions? In response to this question, we propose a Metric-Driven Attribution for explaining Vision Transformers (ViT) called MDA. Guided by attribution quality metrics, the method creates attribution maps by performing patch order and patch magnitude optimization across all patch tokens. The first step orders the patches in terms of importance and the second step assigns the magnitude to each patch while preserving the patch order. Moreover, MDA can provide a smooth trade-off between sparse and dense attributions by modifying the optimization objective. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the proposed MDA method outperforms $7$ existing ViT attribution methods by an average of $12\\%$ across $12$ attribution metrics on the ImageNet dataset for the ViT-base $16 \\times 16$, ViT-tiny $16 \\times 16$, and ViT-base $32 \\times 32$ models.

{"id": "tn2mjzjSyR", "abstract": "Enhancing the capability of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning has gained significant attention in recent years. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various prompting strategies in aiding LLMs in reasoning (called \"reasoning actions\"), such as step-by-step thinking, reflecting before answering, solving with programs, and their combinations. However, these approaches often applied static, predefined reasoning actions uniformly to all questions, without considering the specific characteristics of each question or the capability of the task-solving LLM. In this paper, we propose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason Dynamically via Optimal reasoning Trajectories Search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each question and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. \nOur approach involves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can be composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the optimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative exploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using the collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning trajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning paradigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the task-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an internalized capability for reasoning actions planning. Our experiments across eight reasoning tasks show that our method consistently outperforms static reasoning techniques and the vanilla instruction tuning approach. Further analysis reveals that our method enables LLMs to adjust their computation based on problem complexity, allocating deeper thinking and reasoning to harder problems."}

Sensory-motor integration involves complex neural circuits, diverse neuronal types, and intricate intercellular connections. Bridging the gap between biological realism and behavioral functionality presents a formidable challenge. In this study, we focus on the columnar structure of the superficial layers of mouse barrel cortex as a model system. We constructed a model comprising 4,218 neurons across 13 neuronal subtypes, with neural distribution and connection strengths constrained by anatomical experimental findings. A key innovation of our work is the development of an effective construction and training pipeline tailored for this biologically constrained model. Additionally, we converted an existing simulated whisker sweep dataset into a spiking-based format, enabling our network to be trained and tested on neural signals that more closely mimic those observed in biological systems. The results of object discrimination utilizing whisker signals demonstrate that our barrel cortex model, grounded in biological constraints, achieves a classification accuracy exceeds classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), by an average of 8.6%, and is on par with recent spiking neural networks (SNNs) in performance. Interestingly, a whisker deprivation experiment, designed in accordance with neuroscience practices, further validates the perceptual capabilities of our model in behavioral tasks.\nCritically, it offers significant biological interpretability: post-training analysis reveals that neurons within our model exhibit firing characteristics and distribution patterns similar to those observed in the actual neuronal systems of the barrel cortex. This study advances our understanding of neural processing in the barrel cortex and exemplifies how integrating detailed biological structures into neural network models can enhance both scientific inquiry and artificial intelligence applications.

{"id": "WOzffPgVjF", "abstract": "Transformer has attracted increasing interest in spatio-temporal video grounding, or STVG, owing to its end-to-end pipeline and promising result. Existing Transformer-based STVG approaches often leverage a set of object queries, which are initialized simply using zeros and then gradually learn target position information via iterative interactions with multimodal features, for spatial and temporal localization. Despite simplicity, these zero object queries, due to lacking target-specific cues, are hard to learn discriminative target information from interactions with multimodal features in complicated scenarios (e.g., with distractors or occlusion), resulting in degradation. Addressing this, we introduce a novel $\\textbf{T}$arget-$\\textbf{A}$ware Transformer for $\\textbf{STVG}$ ($\\textbf{TA-STVG}$), which seeks to adaptively generate object queries via exploring target-specific cues from the given video-text pair, for improving STVG. The key lies in two simple yet effective modules, comprising text-guided temporal sampling (TTS) and attribute-aware spatial activation (ASA), working in a cascade. The former focuses on selecting target-relevant temporal cues from a video utilizing holistic text information, while the latter aims at further exploiting the fine-grained visual attribute information of the object from previous target-aware temporal cues, which is applied for object query initialization. Compared to existing methods leveraging zero-initialized queries, object queries in our TA-STVG, directly generated from a given video-text pair, naturally carry target-specific cues, making them adaptive and better interact with multimodal features for learning more discriminative information to improve STVG. In our experiments on three benchmarks, including HCSTVG-v1/-v2 and VidSTG, TA-STVG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms the baseline, validating its efficacy. Moreover, TTS and ASA are designed for general purpose. When applied to existing methods such as TubeDETR and STCAT, we show substantial performance gains, verifying its generality.

Rodimus employs an innovative data-dependent tempered selection (DDTS) mechanism within a linear attention-based, purely recurrent framework, achieving significant accuracy while drastically reducing the memory usage typically associated with recurrent models. This method exemplifies semantic compression by maintaining essential input information with fixed-size hidden states. Building on this, Rodimus$+$ combines Rodimus with the innovative Sliding Window Shared-Key Attention (SW-SKA) in a hybrid approach, effectively leveraging the complementary semantic, token, and head compression techniques.

However, current Mamba multi-modal large language models (MLLM) are insufficient in extracting visual features, leading to imbalanced cross-modal alignment between visual and textural latents, negatively impacting performance on multi-modal tasks. In this work, we propose Empowering Multi-modal Mamba with Structural and Hierarchical Alignment (EMMA), which enables the MLLM to extract fine-grained visual information. Specifically, we propose a pixel-wise alignment module to autoregressively optimize the learning and processing of spatial image-level features along with textual tokens, enabling structural alignment at the image level. In addition, to prevent the degradation of visual information during the cross-model alignment process, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion (MFF) module to combine multi-scale visual features from intermediate layers, enabling hierarchical alignment at the feature level. Extensive experiments are conducted across a variety of multi-modal benchmarks. Our model shows lower latency than other Mamba-based MLLMs and is nearly four times faster than transformer-based MLLMs of similar scale during inference. Due to better cross-modal alignment, our model exhibits lower degrees of hallucination and enhanced sensitivity to visual details, which manifests in superior performance across diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

{"id": "yVGGtsOgc7", "abstract": "Intelligent perception and interaction with the world hinges on internal representations that capture its underlying structure (\"disentangled\" or \"abstract\" representations). Disentangled representations serve as world models, isolating latent factors of variation in the world along approximately orthogonal directions, thus facilitating feature-based generalization. We provide experimental and theoretical results guaranteeing the emergence of disentangled representations in agents that optimally solve multi-task evidence accumulation classification tasks, canonical in the neuroscience literature. The key conceptual finding is that, by producing accurate multi-task classification estimates, a system implicitly represents a set of coordinates specifying a disentangled representation of the underlying latent state of the data it receives. The theory provides conditions for the emergence of these representations in terms of noise, number of tasks, and evidence accumulation time, when the classification boundaries are affine in the latent space. Surprisingly, the theory also produces closed-form expressions for extracting the disentangled representation from the model's latent state $\\mathbf Z(t)$. We experimentally validate these predictions in RNNs trained on multi-task classification, which learn disentangled representations in the form of continuous attractors, leading to zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in predicting latent factors. We demonstrate the robustness of our framework across autoregressive architectures, decision boundary geometries and in tasks requiring classification confidence estimation. We find that transformers are particularly suited for disentangling representations, which might explain their unique world understanding abilities. Overall, our framework establishes a formal link between competence at multiple tasks and the formation of disentangled, interpretable world models in both biological and artificial systems, and helps explain why ANNs often arrive at human-interpretable concepts, and how they both may acquire exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities."}
