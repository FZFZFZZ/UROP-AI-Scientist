  "target_idea": "The paper provides a complete characterization of inputs indistinguishable by models from a given architecture and examines how separability is influenced by hyperparameters and architectural choices. It finds that all non-polynomial activations are equivalent in expressivity, depth improves separation power up to a point, and block decomposition of hidden representations forms a hierarchy in separation power.",
  "context": "The separation power of a machine learning model is crucial for its ability to distinguish between different inputs and is often used to assess its expressivity. Understanding the separation power of model families is essential for achieving detailed universality results. Equivariant neural networks, such as convolutional and permutation-invariant networks, are analyzed for their separation power.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a theoretical framework to analyze and quantify the separation power of hybrid equivariant neural networks that combine multiple types of symmetry (e.g., rotational, translational, and permutation invariance) by integrating differential geometry and group theory. This framework would allow the explicit calculation of the capacity of these networks to distinguish between increasingly fine distinctions in the input space based on the complexity and interaction of symmetries. Utilize the framework to design tailor-made equivariant architectures for specific application domains such as 3D medical imaging or multi-agent systems, optimizing for both accuracy and computational efficiency.",
  "final_idea": "Examine the effect of different activation functions on the separation power of equivariant neural networks, integrating this analysis with the influence of network depth and width to provide a comprehensive understanding of model behavior.",
