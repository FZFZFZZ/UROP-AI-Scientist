Best idea:
Introduce a meta-learning approach where a model is trained to predict the utility of different data subsets for training LLMs, using historical performance data as a basis for learning. This model could then guide the selection of data in a way that is both context-sensitive and adaptive, optimizing for both short-term gains and long-term generalization capabilities.
