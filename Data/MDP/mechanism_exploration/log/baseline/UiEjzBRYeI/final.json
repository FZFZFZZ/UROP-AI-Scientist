  "target_idea": "Introduce SAM-CP, a method that uses two types of composable prompts to enhance SAM for versatile segmentation. Type-I prompts assess alignment between SAM patches and text labels, while Type-II prompts determine if two SAM patches with the same text label belong to the same instance. A unified framework is established to calculate affinity between queries and SAM patches, facilitating the merging of patches with high affinity.",
  "context": "The Segment Anything model (SAM) has demonstrated a generalized capability to group image pixels into patches. However, it encounters significant challenges when applied to semantic-aware segmentation, particularly in handling a large number of semantic classes and patches.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid segmentation model that combines the strengths of SAM with a dynamic transformer architecture designed to enhance semantic understanding. The transformer layer will adaptively assign attention weights based on the semantic context of each patch, effectively handling a vast array of semantic classes by learning context-dependent relationships between them. This approach should reduce the confusion between similar classes and improve the granularity of segmentation in complex scenes.",
  "final_idea": "Adopt a zero-shot learning paradigm in SAM to enable it to handle unseen semantic classes by leveraging semantic descriptions of classes and correlating them with known patches, potentially expanding its applicability without extensive retraining.",
