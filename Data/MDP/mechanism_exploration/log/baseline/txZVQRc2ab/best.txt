Best idea:
Employ a hybrid architecture combining differentially private diffusion models with transfer learning, where a pre-trained non-private model provides a foundational structure that is later fine-tuned using private data under differential privacy constraints. This can potentially reduce the utility loss by relying on robust pre-trained models for initial heavy lifting before privacy-sensitive tuning.
