  "target_idea": "Introduce RAPID, a novel approach that incorporates retrieval augmented generation into DPDM training. RAPID uses public data to create a knowledge base of sample trajectories, retrieves similar trajectories during early sampling steps, and focuses on training later sampling steps in a differentially private manner.",
  "context": "Differentially private diffusion models (DPDMs) are designed to maintain the generative capabilities of diffusion models while ensuring differential privacy for sensitive data. However, current DPDM training methods often experience significant utility loss, large memory requirements, and high inference costs, which limit their practical application.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a multi-stage training framework for differentially private diffusion models where initial stages use coarser, privacy-insensitive synthetic data to establish basic structure and later stages refine the model with actual, privacy-sensitive data under strict differential privacy constraints. This approach would reduce the amount of sensitive data processed directly, thereby preserving more utility and reducing memory and computation overhead. Additionally, include a dynamic privacy budget allocation system that adjusts the amount of noise added based on the complexity and sensitivity of the data being processed at each stage, optimizing both privacy protection and model performance.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a hybrid architecture combining differentially private diffusion models with transfer learning, where a pre-trained non-private model provides a foundational structure that is later fine-tuned using private data under differential privacy constraints. This can potentially reduce the utility loss by relying on robust pre-trained models for initial heavy lifting before privacy-sensitive tuning.",
