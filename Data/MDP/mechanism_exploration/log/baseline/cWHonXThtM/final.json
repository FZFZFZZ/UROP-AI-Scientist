  "target_idea": "Introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework called Mixture of Priors Knowledge Distillation (MiPKD) for image super-resolution models, applicable to various architectures at both feature and block levels. The framework integrates the teacher's knowledge with the student's features using a Feature Prior Mixer and dynamically propagates reconstructed features during training with a Block Prior Mixer.",
  "context": "Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique that transfers learning representations from large, resource-intensive teacher models to smaller, efficient student models. In the domain of image super-resolution, existing methods are often specific to particular teacher-student architectures, which restricts their adaptability and broader application.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning framework for knowledge distillation in image super-resolution that dynamically adapts to different teacher-student model architectures. This framework uses a meta-learner that, during a pre-training phase, learns optimal distillation strategies from a diverse set of teacher-student pairings across varying architectures and image datasets. During deployment, it uses the learned strategies to quickly adapt the distillation process to new, unseen architectures and image domains, maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the student model training without extensive hyperparameter tuning specific to each new scenario.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a universal knowledge distillation framework for image super-resolution that utilizes meta-learning to adapt its parameters to different teacher-student architectures, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of the distillation process across various models and datasets.",
