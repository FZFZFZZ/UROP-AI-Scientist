  "target_idea": "Introduce hyper-connections, a method that allows networks to adjust connection strengths between features at different depths and dynamically rearrange layers, serving as an alternative to residual connections.",
  "context": "Residual connections are commonly used in neural networks to address issues like gradient vanishing and representation collapse. However, these connections often suffer from drawbacks such as the seesaw effect, which can hinder the performance of deep learning models.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic residual connection framework where the weight of the residual path is adaptively adjusted based on the progression of training epochs and the detected variance in gradient flow through the network. This approach could utilize reinforcement learning to optimize the contribution of residual connections, minimizing the seesaw effect by selectively strengthening or weakening these connections based on real-time feedback from the training process. Such a model can maintain efficient gradient propagation and improve convergence rates, particularly in very deep architectures.",
  "final_idea": "Explore the use of adaptive residual modules that can switch between different modes of connectivity, such as dense, sparse, and skip connections, based on the network's current state and error signals.",
