  "target_idea": "Propose end-to-end learnable Gaussian mixture priors (GMPs) to improve exploration control, adaptability to target support, and expressiveness to counteract mode collapse. Introduce a strategy to iteratively refine the model by adding mixture components during training.",
  "context": "Diffusion models optimized via variational inference are used for generating samples from unnormalized target densities by simulating a stochastic differential equation starting from a simple prior, usually a Gaussian distribution. These models face challenges when the prior's support differs significantly from the target distribution, leading to exploration difficulties and large discretization errors. Additionally, learning the prior distribution can cause mode-collapse due to the mode-seeking nature of reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive prior adjustment mechanism for diffusion models that iteratively refines the prior distribution based on feedback loops from intermediate distributions encountered during the diffusion process. This mechanism would utilize a series of auxiliary networks trained to predict the divergence between the current model's prior and the target distribution at each step, using these predictions to dynamically adjust the parameters of the prior. Through this adaptive approach, the model could more effectively navigate diverse density regions, potentially reducing mode-collapse by maintaining a broader and more flexible exploration of the distribution space.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a mixture of Gaussians as the prior, where the components and their parameters are learned dynamically during training, allowing the model to better approximate complex and multimodal target distributions and potentially reduce mode-collapse.",
