  "target_idea": "Introduce Diff3DS, a differentiable rendering framework that generates view-consistent 3D sketches by optimizing 3D parametric curves. This framework uses perspective projection to render 3D rational BÃ©zier curves into 2D curves, which are then converted into 2D raster images through a customized differentiable rasterizer, enabling end-to-end optimization of 3D sketches using gradients from the 2D image domain.",
  "context": "3D sketches are commonly used to visually represent the shape and structure of objects or scenes in three dimensions. However, creating these sketches typically requires professional artistic skills, and existing research has mainly focused on improving interactive sketch generation in 3D virtual systems.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an AI-driven tool that automatically translates verbal descriptions into 3D sketches by employing advanced natural language processing and machine learning models trained on a dataset of descriptions and their corresponding sketches. This tool could understand complex spatial and textural descriptions, enabling users to create detailed 3-dimensional representations without any prior sketching skills. Additionally, incorporate AR technology to allow users to visualize and interact with their generated sketches in real-time, enhancing both the creative process and the accuracy of the final 3D model.",
  "final_idea": "Incorporate a multi-view consistency module into the GAN that ensures the 3D sketches remain consistent when viewed from different angles, using geometric deep learning techniques to understand and maintain the spatial relationships in the sketches.",
