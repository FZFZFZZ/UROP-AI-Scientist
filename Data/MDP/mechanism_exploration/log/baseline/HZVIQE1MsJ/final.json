  "target_idea": "Utilize the language model itself to learn from preference data by prompting it to generate initial judgment pairs with contrastive preferences in natural language. This approach, termed LLM-as-a-Judge, employs Direct Preference Optimization to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities, ensuring interpretability through generated rationales and demonstrating increased robustness against bias.",
  "context": "Learning from preference feedback is a common method for aligning large language models with human values. Traditionally, this involves encoding preference data into a scalar reward model, which connects a value head with a language model to produce a scalar score. However, these scalar models often lack interpretability and are prone to biases present in datasets.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a multi-dimensional reward model that captures various aspects of human values such as fairness, empathy, and accuracy, each represented as separate dimensions in the reward space. Introduce a dynamic weighting system that adapts the influence of each dimension based on the context of the interaction or feedback to reflect changing societal norms and individual user preferences over time. This approach would not only enhance the interpretability of the model by allowing distinct visibility into how different values are weighted in decision-making processes, but also reduce bias by dynamically adjusting to diverse and evolving ethical standards.",
  "final_idea": "Utilize a multi-task learning framework where the language model not only predicts scalar rewards but also generates explanations for its decisions, thereby training the model to inherently provide interpretable outputs alongside its evaluations.",
