  "target_idea": "Introduce MuHBoost, a multi-label boosting method that uses advanced large language model prompting and multi-label classification to predict multiple health outcomes. To address the issue of LLMs hallucinating when handling multiple questions, two variants of MuHBoost are developed to improve predictive performance.",
  "context": "Longitudinal human behavior modeling is crucial for applications like patient monitoring and lifestyle recommendations, using data from devices such as smartphones and smartwatches. This field aims to predict health outcomes based on time series of individual behaviors. However, existing models often lack accuracy and fail to consider realistic data aspects like diverse feature types and high missing value rates, as well as resource consumption issues, making their practical application questionable.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid machine learning model that integrates multi-modal data fusion techniques with probabilistic graphical models to address the challenge of diverse feature types and high missing value rates in longitudinal human behavior data. This model will use Bayesian networks to estimate missing values and infer causal relationships among behaviors and health outcomes, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can process sensor data from devices for real-time predictions. Additionally, implement a model shrinking algorithm post-training to reduce the model's resource consumption without compromising predictive accuracy, ensuring its feasibility for deployment on low-power devices like smartphones and smartwatches.",
  "final_idea": "Apply a multi-task learning approach to the hybrid model to simultaneously predict multiple health outcomes and behavioral patterns, which can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the user's health and potentially increase the predictive accuracy by leveraging shared information across tasks.",
