Introduce a 'Meta-Tactic Evaluator' that assesses the potential effectiveness of proposed tactics using a predictive model trained on historical proof outcomes. This evaluator could adjust the rewards in the reinforcement learning framework, prioritizing tactics that not only vary semantically but also show higher chances of success based on past data, thus refining the selection process in the Diverse Tactical Generator.
