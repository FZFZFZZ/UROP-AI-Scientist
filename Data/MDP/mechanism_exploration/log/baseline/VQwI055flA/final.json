  "target_idea": "Propose CARTS (diversified tactic CAlibration and bias-Resistant Tree Search), which enhances tactic diversity and importance while calibrating model confidence. CARTS also incorporates preference modeling and an adjustment term related to the ratio of valid tactics to improve the bias-resistance of the value function.",
  "context": "Recent advancements in neural theorem proving involve integrating large language models with tree search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In this setup, the language model suggests tactics while the tree search identifies the complete proof path. However, the tactics proposed often converge to semantically or strategically similar ones, reducing diversity and increasing search costs by expanding redundant proof paths. Additionally, the trained value function faces issues such as false negatives, label imbalance, and domain gaps due to biased data construction.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a \"Diverse Tactical Generator\" module within the language model that employs reinforcement learning to penalize semantically similar tactics over successive iterations and rewards the exploration of diverse strategic regions. This module can use a combination of semantic embedding distance and a novelty scoring mechanism to guide the language model in proposing varied but potentially fruitful tactics. Additionally, integrate a feedback loop from the end-results of the Monte Carlo Tree Search, such that the success or failure of diverse tactics can be used to fine-tune the diversity-promoting penalty in future proofs, optimizing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in proof search paths.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a 'Meta-Tactic Evaluator' that assesses the potential effectiveness of proposed tactics using a predictive model trained on historical proof outcomes. This evaluator could adjust the rewards in the reinforcement learning framework, prioritizing tactics that not only vary semantically but also show higher chances of success based on past data, thus refining the selection process in the Diverse Tactical Generator.",
