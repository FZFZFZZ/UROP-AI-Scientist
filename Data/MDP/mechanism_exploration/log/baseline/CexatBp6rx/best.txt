Best idea:
Develop a dual-model system where one model focuses on unsupervised learning of high-level concepts and the other on generating synthetic images that highlight these concepts. This would allow users to see direct visual representations of how the model perceives different concepts, bridging the gap between abstract features and tangible visualizations.
