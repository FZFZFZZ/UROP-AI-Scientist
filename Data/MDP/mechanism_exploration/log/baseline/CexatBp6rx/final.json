  "target_idea": "Propose a novel method that maps concept features to the latent space of a pretrained generative model, enabling high-quality visualization and providing an intuitive, interactive procedure for interpreting learnt concepts by imputing concept activations and visualizing generated modifications.",
  "context": "In recent years, there has been a growing focus on developing inherently interpretable models for prediction, particularly those that learn high-level concepts. These models are valued for their ability to represent concepts in a way that is close to human communication. However, a significant challenge arises in visualizing and understanding the unsupervised dictionary of concepts, especially when dealing with large-scale images.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a concept-based interpretable modeling system that integrates interactive visualization tools with unsupervised learning algorithms to dynamically map and display the relationships between high-level concepts and image features. These tools would allow users to adjust the parameters of the unsupervised learning process in real-time, observing how changes affect concept formation and feature association. This approach would facilitate a more intuitive understanding of how abstract concepts are encoded by the model and enhance the transparency of the prediction mechanisms in large-scale image processing applications.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a dual-model system where one model focuses on unsupervised learning of high-level concepts and the other on generating synthetic images that highlight these concepts. This would allow users to see direct visual representations of how the model perceives different concepts, bridging the gap between abstract features and tangible visualizations.",
