  "target_idea": "Introduce RxnFlow, a model that assembles molecules using predefined molecular building blocks and chemical reaction templates to ensure a feasible synthetic pathway. It employs generative flow networks (GFlowNets) for training and incorporates a novel action space subsampling method to handle large action spaces efficiently, allowing for flexible adaptation to new objectives or building blocks without retraining.",
  "context": "Generative models have become popular in drug discovery as efficient alternatives to traditional virtual screening methods. However, a major limitation of these models is their lack of consideration for synthesizability, which restricts their practical application in real-world drug development.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a generative model framework that incorporates a synthesizability predictor module within its architecture. This predictor would use machine learning to assess the chemical synthesis complexity of generated molecules in real-time, providing feedback to the generative model to steer molecule design towards compounds that are not only potentially efficacious but also easily synthesizable. This integrated approach ensures that the output of the generative model is more aligned with pragmatic drug development needs, potentially accelerating the transition from discovery to manufacturing.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a graph-based representation of molecules in the generative model, which can be directly linked to a database of synthetic reactions, allowing the model to generate molecules with known synthetic routes.",
