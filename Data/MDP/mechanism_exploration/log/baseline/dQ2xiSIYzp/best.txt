Best idea:
Employ a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that uses pose and shape priors as conditions. This method would refine the initial 3D model by adjusting the generated output to align with the priors, which are dynamically updated as more of the occluded regions are inferred from the input image and intermediate outputs.
