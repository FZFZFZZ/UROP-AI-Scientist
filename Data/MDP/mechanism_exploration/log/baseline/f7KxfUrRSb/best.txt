Best idea:
Apply a transfer learning approach to the co-evolution framework, where a pre-trained strong model is fine-tuned using the outputs from the weaker model. This could accelerate the alignment process by leveraging existing knowledge and focusing training efforts on filling gaps in the model's understanding of human preferences.
