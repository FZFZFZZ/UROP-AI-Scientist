  "target_idea": "Propose a method called Weak-to-Strong Preference Optimization (WSPO) that achieves strong model alignment by learning the distribution differences before and after the alignment of the weak model, effectively transferring and amplifying alignment behavior from weaker to stronger models.",
  "context": "Aligning language models with human preferences is a significant research focus, aiming to enhance the models' ability to meet diverse user needs. The concept of weak-to-strong generalization, where a strong language model fine-tuned on labels from a weaker model can outperform its supervisor, serves as an inspiration for improving model alignment.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an iterative co-evolution framework for language model alignment that uses a series of weak and strong models. Start with a basic language model that generates labels and descriptions based on initial human preferences. These outputs are then used to train a stronger model, which in turn supervises a new, even weaker model designed specifically to challenge and expand the stronger model's understanding of complex or underrepresented preferences. This cyclical process progressively refines alignment through a dynamic dialogue between generational strengths and weaknesses, continually calibrating to human preference nuances.",
  "final_idea": "Apply a transfer learning approach to the co-evolution framework, where a pre-trained strong model is fine-tuned using the outputs from the weaker model. This could accelerate the alignment process by leveraging existing knowledge and focusing training efforts on filling gaps in the model's understanding of human preferences.",
