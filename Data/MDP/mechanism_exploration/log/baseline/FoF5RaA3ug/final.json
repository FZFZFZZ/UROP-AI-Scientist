  "target_idea": "Introduce GIFT, a simple plug-and-play approach that includes soft label refinement and a cosine similarity-based loss function to fully utilize label information, enhancing dataset distillation methods without additional computational costs.",
  "context": "Recent advancements in dataset distillation have shown the benefits of using soft labels generated by pre-trained teacher models. However, the choice of loss function for utilizing these soft labels significantly affects the performance of models trained on synthetic datasets, indicating the need for a universal loss function.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive loss function for training models on synthetic datasets with soft labels, which dynamically adjusts based on the model's performance at different stages of training. This function would initially prioritize minimizing the difference between the soft labels and the student model's predictions, but gradually incorporate terms to enforce structural and distributional alignment between the synthetic dataset and real data distributions. The adaptiveness could be governed by reinforcement learning algorithms that optimize loss function parameters to maximize validation accuracy, dynamically changing its behavior based on real-time feedback from the training process.",
  "final_idea": "Design a loss function that incorporates a knowledge distillation component, where the distance between the soft labels of the teacher model and the predictions of the student model is minimized, along with a cross-entropy term for ground truth alignment.",
