  "target_idea": "Introduce AniSDF, a novel approach that learns fused-granularity neural surfaces with physics-based encoding for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. This method balances overall structures and fine geometric details, and uses blended radiance fields with anisotropic spherical Gaussian encoding to separate geometry from reflective appearance, enabling accurate geometry reconstruction and high-quality renderings without complex hyperparameter tuning.",
  "context": "Neural radiance fields have significantly advanced novel-view synthesis, achieving high-quality renderings. However, these methods often compromise on geometry accuracy, which limits their application in areas such as relighting and deformation. The challenge remains to synthesize photo-realistic renderings while accurately reconstructing geometry.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid neural model that integrates neural radiance fields with differential geometric tools to enhance geometry reconstruction. This model would utilize curvature-based loss functions derived from differential geometry to guide the training of neural radiance fields, focusing specifically on achieving high geometric fidelity at complex surfaces and edges. Simultaneously, the model would leverage multi-view consistency checks to refine the synthesizing process of novel views, ensuring both photorealistic texture rendering and accurate geometry.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a feature disentanglement strategy in neural radiance fields, separating geometry and appearance features explicitly in the model architecture to allow for independent manipulation and enhancement of geometric detail.",
