  "target_idea": "Introduce two strategies for producing MI explanations: 'where-then-what', which identifies a network subset replicating behavior before deriving its interpretation, and 'what-then-where', which starts with candidate algorithms and searches for their implementation in the network's activation subspaces, using causal alignment between algorithm states and the network.",
  "context": "As AI systems are increasingly used in critical applications, ensuring their interpretability is crucial. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) seeks to reverse-engineer neural networks to extract human-understandable algorithms that explain their behavior. A fundamental question arises: for a fixed behavior, can MI guarantee a unique explanation? This is analogous to the concept of identifiability in statistics, which ensures the uniqueness of inferred parameters under specific assumptions.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an AI-driven system incorporating both adaptive testing and mechanism variance analysis to trace and identify instances where different configurations of neural networks yield the same output behavior. By systematically altering specific neural connections and monitoring the output variability, this approach would detect zones of non-identifiability within the network. This insight could be used to refine training processes and architectural choices, strengthening the guarantee that mechanistic interpretability results in unique and reliable explanations of AI behavior.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a constraint-based optimization technique that incorporates prior domain knowledge to guide the MI process, potentially leading to a unique and more accurate explanation by aligning the model's behavior with known causal relationships.",
