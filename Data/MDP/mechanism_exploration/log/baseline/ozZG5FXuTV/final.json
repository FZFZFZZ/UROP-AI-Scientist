  "target_idea": "Propose a causality-based alignment framework that uses counterfactual generation to identify the causal chain of model decisions and introduces a causal alignment loss to ensure the model focuses on causal factors. This approach employs the implicit function theorem and the conjugate gradient method for efficient optimization of the alignment process.",
  "context": "Aligning machine learning algorithms with the decision-making processes of experienced radiologists is essential for reliable medical diagnosis. Existing methods have primarily focused on associational alignment with radiologists' behaviors as reflected in training data, which can lead to pseudo-correlations that do not generalize well.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic simulation platform where AI models and radiologists interact in real-time. In this virtual environment, radiologists make diagnostic decisions while the AI not only observes but also queries the radiologist about unusual cases or apparent discrepancies. This continual interaction allows the AI to learn and align with the underlying cognitive processes and heuristics used by expert radiologists, rather than merely mimicking observable decisions, thus enhancing the model's generalizability and reliability in clinical applications.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a hybrid model that integrates both counterfactual reasoning and causal inference, aiming to mimic the decision-making process of radiologists by understanding underlying causal relationships in medical imaging data.",
