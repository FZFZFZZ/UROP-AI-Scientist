  "target_idea": "Introduce BLEND, a behavior-guided neural population dynamics modeling framework using privileged knowledge distillation. This approach involves training a teacher model with both behavioral and neural data, and then distilling a student model using only neural activity. BLEND is model-agnostic and does not rely on strong assumptions about the behavior-neural activity relationship, allowing it to enhance existing architectures without the need for specialized models.",
  "context": "Modeling the nonlinear dynamics of neuronal populations is a significant challenge in computational neuroscience. Recent efforts have focused on jointly modeling neural activity and behavior to understand their interconnections, but these often require complex models or oversimplified assumptions. A key issue arises from the lack of perfectly paired neural-behavioral datasets in real-world applications, leading to the question of how to develop models that perform well using only neural activity at inference while leveraging behavioral insights during training.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid modeling framework that integrates transfer learning with generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enhance the modeling of neuronal populations. In the training phase, the discriminator learns to distinguish between neural activity patterns corresponding to real observed behaviors and those generated by the GAN, using a rich dataset where both neural and behavioral data are available. During inference in a real-world setting where only neural data are present, the generator, pre-trained and fine-tuned using behavioral insights, synthesizes the missing behavioral context, thus allowing the model to make more accurate predictions about neural dynamics based on learned interconnections.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a transfer learning framework that utilizes auxiliary tasks related to behavioral prediction during the initial training phase on rich neural-behavioral datasets. Subsequently, the model could be adapted to focus solely on neural activity prediction in the target domain, potentially enhancing its predictive accuracy without direct behavioral data.",
