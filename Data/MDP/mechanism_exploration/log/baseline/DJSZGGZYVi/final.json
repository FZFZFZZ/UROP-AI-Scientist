  "target_idea": "Introduce a regularization technique called REPresentation Alignment (REPA), which aligns the projections of noisy input hidden states in denoising networks with clean image representations from external, pretrained visual encoders to enhance training efficiency and generation quality.",
  "context": "Recent studies have identified that the denoising process in generative diffusion models can create meaningful representations, but these are not as effective as those from self-supervised learning methods. A significant challenge in training large-scale diffusion models is effectively learning these representations, which can be improved by using high-quality external visual representations instead of relying solely on the models themselves.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid training framework that integrates self-supervised learning methods with generative diffusion models to enhance representation learning. During the diffusion process, feature representations from a separately trained self-supervised model (e.g., based on contrastive loss) are injected at various stages to guide the denoising steps. This approach leverages the strengths of robust feature extraction in self-supervised models with the generative capabilities of diffusion models, aiming to produce more meaningful and versatile representations suitable for complex visual tasks.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a regularization term in the diffusion model's training objective that aligns the latent space representations with those obtained from a pre-trained self-supervised model, potentially using a contrastive loss to enhance similarity.",
