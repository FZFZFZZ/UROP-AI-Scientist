  "target_idea": "Introduce Mixed Time-step Training (MTT), a method that enhances the temporal flexibility of SNNs by allowing them to adapt to various temporal structures. MTT assigns random time steps to different SNN stages during training, facilitating communication between stages via modules, and enabling deployment on both time-stepped and fully event-driven platforms.",
  "context": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are inspired by brain mechanisms and offer energy-efficient implementation on neuromorphic hardware. However, current direct training approaches limit SNNs to specific time steps, causing issues with deployment on time-step-free event-driven chips and hindering energy-performance balance through dynamic inference time steps.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning algorithm specifically designed for SNNs that dynamically adjusts the network topology and synaptic weights based on the temporal patterns of incoming spikes, rather than fixed time steps. This approach would enable SNNs to learn optimal configurations for varying temporal densities of input data, thus enhancing their adaptability for deployment on event-driven neuromorphic hardware. The self-optimizing nature of this meta-algorithm could effectively balance energy consumption and performance in real-time, maximizing the efficiency of neuromorphic computing across diverse applications.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a modular approach in SNN training where different modules of the network are trained with varying time steps, tailored to the specific temporal dynamics of the input they process, thus enhancing overall network efficiency and flexibility.",
