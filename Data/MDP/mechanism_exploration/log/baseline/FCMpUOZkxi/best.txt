Best idea:
Develop a regret minimization strategy specific to CBwK that dynamically adjusts exploration and exploitation based on the remaining budget and observed cost distributions. This approach would focus on minimizing long-term regret by balancing the need to explore new actions with the risk of budget depletion.
