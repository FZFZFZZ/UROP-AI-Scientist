  "target_idea": "Introduce CausalRivers, a comprehensive benchmarking kit for causal discovery in time-series data, featuring extensive datasets from river discharge measurements in Germany. It includes causal ground truth graphs that can be sampled to create diverse subgraphs for benchmarking, aiming to facilitate robust evaluations and comparisons of causal discovery methods.",
  "context": "Causal discovery involves identifying causal relationships from observational data, a task that is notoriously difficult due to the complexity, non-linearity, and evolving nature of real-world causal structures. Existing methods often rely on synthetic data and limited real-world examples, which do not adequately capture these complexities, making it challenging to select an appropriate causal discovery strategy.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic, adaptive causal discovery framework that utilizes reinforcement learning to iteratively refine its understanding of causal relationships in real-time data streams. The framework would start with base assumptions drawn from a combination of existing causal models and expert domain knowledge, then use feedback from observed outcomes to adjust the causal links and strength of interactions. This approach not only learns and updates the causal model as new data becomes available, but also adapts to changes in the underlying causal structure over time, making it robust to the evolving nature of real-world systems.",
  "final_idea": "Create a benchmark suite of real-world datasets across various domains to evaluate the performance of causal discovery algorithms, providing a more comprehensive assessment of their effectiveness in practical applications.",
