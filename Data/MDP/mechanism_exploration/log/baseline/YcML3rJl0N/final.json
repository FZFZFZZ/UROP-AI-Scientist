  "target_idea": "Propose regularizing Evidential Deep Learning by incorporating an information bottleneck, creating IB-EDL, which suppresses spurious information and enhances the influence of predictive information on predictions and uncertainty estimates.",
  "context": "Fine-tuned large language models often suffer from overconfidence, especially when trained on small datasets, leading to poor calibration and inaccurate uncertainty estimates. Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) offers a computationally efficient method for uncertainty estimation but is susceptible to overfitting, resulting in overly concentrated probability distributions.",
  "initial_idea": "Integrate an adaptive regularization mechanism into Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) frameworks that dynamically adjusts strength based on the diversity and size of the training data. This mechanism could measure the entropy of the predictions during training and increase regularization when predictions become overly confident relative to the training set variance. This approach would enhance model calibration by preventing the overconfidence problem and adapting the modelâ€™s uncertainty estimates to reflect the true data complexity.",
  "final_idea": "Explore the use of information-theoretic measures such as mutual information to regularize the uncertainty estimates in Evidential Deep Learning, ensuring that the model preserves useful uncertainty without becoming overly confident.",
