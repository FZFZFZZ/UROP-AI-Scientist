Best idea:
Develop a dynamic influence estimation model that adapts to the varying sensitivities of training data over different stages of model learning. This approach could incorporate reinforcement learning techniques where an agent learns to assign influence scores to data points based on the optimization trajectory, effectively capturing how the significance of individual data instances evolves across various phases of training. This model would integrate temporal data ordering into the training process, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of data influence in non-stationary, modern training environments.
