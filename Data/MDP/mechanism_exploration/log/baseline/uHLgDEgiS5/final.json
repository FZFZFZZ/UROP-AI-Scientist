  "target_idea": "Introduce the concept of trajectory-specific leave-one-out (LOO) influence to quantify the impact of removing a data point from a specific iteration during training, considering the data sequence and optimization trajectory. Propose data value embedding, a technique for efficiently approximating trajectory-specific LOO by computing a training data embedding that captures interactions between data and model parameters, allowing approximation through a dot-product with the test data gradient.",
  "context": "Traditional data influence estimation methods, such as influence functions, assume that learning algorithms are permutation-invariant with respect to training data. However, modern training paradigms, particularly for foundation models using stochastic algorithms and non-convergent, multi-stage curricula, are sensitive to data ordering, violating this assumption. This mismatch makes influence functions inadequate for addressing questions about the influence of data at different training stages and its dependence on the optimization trajectory.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic influence estimation model that adapts to the varying sensitivities of training data over different stages of model learning. This approach could incorporate reinforcement learning techniques where an agent learns to assign influence scores to data points based on the optimization trajectory, effectively capturing how the significance of individual data instances evolves across various phases of training. This model would integrate temporal data ordering into the training process, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of data influence in non-stationary, modern training environments.",
