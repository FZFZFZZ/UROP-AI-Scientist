  "target_idea": "Introduce the Automatic Cohort Extraction System (ACES) for event-stream data, which simplifies the development and reproduction of tasks and cohorts in ML for healthcare. ACES offers a domain-specific configuration language for defining dataset-specific and agnostic criteria, and a pipeline to automatically extract patient records that meet these criteria from real-world data.",
  "context": "Reproducibility is a major challenge in machine learning for healthcare due to the private nature of datasets, model pipelines, and task or cohort definitions. This creates barriers in sharing, iterating, and understanding ML results on electronic health record datasets.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a federated learning platform specifically designed for healthcare data, where algorithms are trained across multiple decentralized datasets without exchanging the data itself. This platform would implement standardized, transparent, and version-controlled model pipelines and task definitions to ensure consistency and comprehensibility across different studies. Additionally, it could include a blockchain-based audit trail feature to log each step of the model's development and training process, enhancing the reproducibility and trustworthiness of the research.",
  "final_idea": "Encourage the development of domain-specific languages and libraries in healthcare ML that standardize data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation to reduce variability in research outputs.",
