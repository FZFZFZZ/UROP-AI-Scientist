  "target_idea": "Develop a model merging methodology that enhances cross-lingual transfer by composing language and math capabilities. This involves fine-tuning separate 'experts' on math instruction data in English and generic instruction data in the target language, then swapping the top and bottom transformer layers between these experts to improve math performance in the target language.",
  "context": "Model merging, such as model souping, involves combining models with the same architecture without additional training. Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks in non-English languages is challenging due to the lack of task-specific data, particularly for mathematical reasoning tasks.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a cross-linguistic transfer learning approach where a cluster of LLMs, each pre-trained in different languages, are merged using model souping. Utilize a meta-algorithm that selectively extracts and integrates segments of each model that show high performance on mathematical reasoning tasks in their respective languages. This could particularly enhance performance by leveraging diverse linguistic structures and idiomatic expressions related to numerical and logical reasoning found across languages, thus improving the LLM's overall ability to handle mathematical tasks in multiple languages without extensive task-specific data.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a cross-lingual transfer learning framework that leverages the strengths of model souping by combining the top-performing layers from monolingual models trained on mathematical tasks, followed by a meta-learning phase to optimize layer selection and weighting for maximal performance across languages.",
