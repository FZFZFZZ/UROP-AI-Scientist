  "target_idea": "Propose a system that optimizes KV-cache allocation by identifying the importance of attention layers, allowing for joint optimization across sequence-wise and layer-wise dimensions. This involves measuring each layer's importance through cosine similarity of input prompt differences and adjusting KV budgets accordingly, incorporating sequence-wise algorithms for layer-specific compression.",
  "context": "Optimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for reducing inference costs. Existing KV-cache compression methods often focus on sparsifying token sequences by leveraging token importance but typically allocate the same KV budget across all layers, which is inefficient as different layers have varying sensitivity to input tokens.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic layer-sensitive adaptive compression method for KV caches in LLMs that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize cache allocation across different layers. An RL agent can learn from the model inference patterns to allocate a variable KV budget to layers based on their sensitivity and contribution to performance metrics such as accuracy and speed. The RL approach would adjust in real time to changes in input complexity and model demands, thereby maximizing efficiency and minimizing costs.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a multi-tier adaptive KV cache architecture that dynamically reallocates memory resources between layers based on real-time analysis of token usage patterns and layer-specific performance degradation metrics.",
