Best idea:
Develop a contrastive learning framework that integrates multimodal molecular data, including chemical structure, genomic data, and metabolic pathways, to discover novel antibiotic compounds. This model could use unsupervised learning to identify latent representations that differentiate effective antibiotics from non-effective compounds across different bacterial species. By highlighting subtle molecular differences that correlate with antibiotic potency and spectrum of activity, this approach could prioritize compounds for synthesis and testing that are likely to be effective against resistant bacterial strains.
