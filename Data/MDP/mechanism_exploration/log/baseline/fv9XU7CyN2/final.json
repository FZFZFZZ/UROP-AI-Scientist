  "target_idea": "Introduce CL-MFAP, an unsupervised contrastive learning-based multimodal foundation model designed to discover small molecules with antibiotic potential using three types of molecular data. The model pretrains three encoders: a transformer-based encoder for SMILES strings, another transformer-based encoder with a bi-level routing attention mechanism for molecular graphs, and a Morgan fingerprint encoder using a multilayer perceptron, leveraging 1.6 million bioactive molecules from the ChEMBL dataset.",
  "context": "The rise in antimicrobial resistance has made it crucial to identify new antibiotic compounds, as traditional drug development methods are costly and inefficient. Machine learning techniques have been explored to improve the prediction and development of novel antibiotics, but current efforts have not fully utilized the potential of multimodal molecular data. Contrastive learning frameworks have shown promise in representation learning across various domains, suggesting potential for antibiotic discovery.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a contrastive learning framework that integrates multimodal molecular data, including chemical structure, genomic data, and metabolic pathways, to discover novel antibiotic compounds. This model could use unsupervised learning to identify latent representations that differentiate effective antibiotics from non-effective compounds across different bacterial species. By highlighting subtle molecular differences that correlate with antibiotic potency and spectrum of activity, this approach could prioritize compounds for synthesis and testing that are likely to be effective against resistant bacterial strains.",
