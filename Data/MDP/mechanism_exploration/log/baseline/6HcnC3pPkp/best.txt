Best idea:
Integrate a probabilistic modeling framework with the verifier to estimate the likelihood of each branch leading to a successful solution, using Bayesian inference to update these probabilities dynamically as more information becomes available during the tree search. This model will allow the verifier to make more informed decisions based on statistical evidence from the search process.
