  "target_idea": "Introduce token-supervised value models (TVMs), a new class of verifiers that assign probabilities to each token, indicating the likelihood of reaching the correct final answer. This token-level supervision allows TVMs to directly evaluate partial solutions, effectively distinguishing between promising and incorrect intermediate steps during tree search.",
  "context": "The rapid advancement of test-time compute search strategies has highlighted the need for robust verifiers to enhance the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Current inference strategies depend on verifiers designed for Best-of-N search, which are not optimal for tree search techniques. These existing verifiers provide indirect assessments of partial solutions and may undervalue promising intermediate steps, leading to premature pruning during tree search.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic verifier adapted specifically for tree search algorithms in LLMs, which evaluates the potential of partial solutions based on a contextual understanding of the entire solution tree. This verifier utilizes a reinforcement learning approach where feedback from both successful and unsuccessful branches informs its assessment strategy, effectively learning to recognize and preserve solution paths that may not initially appear optimal but have high potential based on deeper or subsequent connections in the tree. This adaptive verification method allows for more nuanced pruning decisions, reducing the risk of discarding valuable intermediate solutions and enhancing the overall problem-solving efficiency of the LLM.",
  "final_idea": "Integrate a probabilistic modeling framework with the verifier to estimate the likelihood of each branch leading to a successful solution, using Bayesian inference to update these probabilities dynamically as more information becomes available during the tree search. This model will allow the verifier to make more informed decisions based on statistical evidence from the search process.",
