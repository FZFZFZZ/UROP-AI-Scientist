  "target_idea": "Introduce InnerSightNet, an algorithm that analyzes the inner workings of deep neural networks by examining neuron communities. It operates in three phases: transforming learnable units into a structured network, aggregating neurons into communities, and evaluating these communities to understand information flow and decision-making.",
  "context": "Deep learning has made significant progress in various advanced fields, but its 'black box' nature creates challenges in understanding and trusting the decision-making processes of neural networks.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid deep learning model that incorporates symbolic reasoning alongside traditional neural network architectures to enhance interpretability. This model will use symbolic AI to create explicit, traceable reasoning paths for decisions made by the neural network. By embedding symbolic reasoning directly into the architecture, the model can generate human-readable explanations for its outputs, thereby addressing the trust and understanding issues associated with deep learning's 'black box' nature.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a visualization tool that uses graph-based techniques to represent the flow of information through a neural network. This tool would map out the connections and activations across layers, providing a visual interpretation of the networkâ€™s decision-making process.",
