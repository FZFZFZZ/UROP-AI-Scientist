  "target_idea": "Propose Shapley-Guided Utility Learning (SGUL), a framework that combines transferable data-specific and model-specific features to approximate test accuracy without ground truth labels. SGUL uses Shapley values as a preprocessing step and feature Shapley values as input to optimize Shapley value prediction directly, reducing computational demands and improving generalization to unseen test-time structures.",
  "context": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success in various graph-based machine learning tasks. However, a major challenge remains in evaluating the importance of neighbors of testing nodes, as it is difficult to assess data importance without having access to test labels.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a self-supervised learning approach for GNNs where the model generates pseudo-labels for nodes during testing based on their structural role and feature similarity within the graph. Use these pseudo-labels to assess the importance of neighboring nodes by analyzing how changes in neighbors' features or connections impact the pseudo-labeled prediction accuracy. This method would provide a dynamic way to evaluate neighbor importance without requiring access to actual test labels, enhancing the interpretability and robustness of GNNs in real-world applications where labels are scarce or unavailable.",
  "final_idea": "Apply a game-theoretical approach to GNNs where nodes and their neighbors are considered as players in a cooperative game, and the payouts are based on the contribution to overall prediction accuracy. This method would mathematically formalize neighbor importance and provide a strategy-proof mechanism to evaluate it.",
