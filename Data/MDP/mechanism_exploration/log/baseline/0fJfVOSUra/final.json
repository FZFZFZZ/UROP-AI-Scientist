  "target_idea": "Introduce ThunderKittens (TK), a framework that simplifies writing performant AI kernels through key abstractions. These abstractions map to the GPU hierarchy levels: providing 16x16 matrix tiles and PyTorch-like operations at the warp-level, templates for asynchronous operations at the thread-block level, and tools to manage block launch and memory costs at the grid-level.",
  "context": "Mapping AI architectures to GPU hardware is a significant bottleneck in AI development. Despite efforts, custom kernels often fail to achieve optimal performance, even for established operations like linear attention. The complexity and diverse capabilities of GPUs suggest a need for varied techniques to achieve high performance.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning algorithm that optimizes the mapping of AI architectures to specific GPU configurations by dynamically learning from past compilation and execution data. This algorithm would utilize reinforcement learning to identify and refine the best practices for kernel customization and scheduling on different GPUs, focusing on critical factors such as memory bandwidth and compute capability. It could continuously update its models based on real-world application performance, effectively creating a self-improving system for AI deployment across varied hardware setups.",
  "final_idea": "Design a set of high-level abstractions for AI development that automatically optimize underlying GPU utilization without requiring detailed hardware knowledge from the developer. These abstractions could be integrated into popular AI frameworks to enhance accessibility and performance.",
