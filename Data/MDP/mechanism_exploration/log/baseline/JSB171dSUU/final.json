  "target_idea": "Propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) routing method that uses language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing, inspired by circuit theory, to enhance multilingual LLMs. Develop the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing in later layers, and introduce 'language family' experts to scale the model to 50 languages without adding parameters.",
  "context": "Adapting medical Large Language Models (LLMs) to local languages can help reduce barriers to healthcare access, but a major challenge is the scarcity of data, especially for low-resource languages. This necessitates the creation of high-quality medical datasets and an understanding of how multilingual LLMs can generalize to these languages.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a federated learning approach for medical LLMs where healthcare providers in different regions contribute to a shared model without transferring data, preserving privacy and local peculiarities. This model will learn from decentralized, multilingual inputs, adapting to local languages by generating synthetic medical texts in low-resource languages based on the patterns learned from available high-resource language data. This approach not only addresses the scarcity of data but also enhances the model's ability to generalize across diverse linguistic contexts.",
  "final_idea": "Create a modular LLM architecture that allows for plug-and-play components for different languages, where language-specific modules can be developed independently and integrated into the core model as they become available.",
