  "target_idea": "Introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model that adapts the diffusion process for dense prediction by training to predict annotations directly instead of noise, and reformulating the diffusion process into a single-step procedure. Additionally, implement a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver to achieve more accurate and fine-grained predictions.",
  "context": "Pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have potential for improving zero-shot generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, the traditional diffusion formulation used in these models may not be optimal for dense prediction due to differences from image generation tasks. Existing methods often use the original diffusion approach without considering these differences, which can lead to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a novel attention-based layer specifically for pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to enhance zero-shot generalization for dense prediction tasks. This layer would dynamically adjust the diffusion process based on spatial dependencies and contextual relevance specific to the prediction task, rather than applying a uniform diffusion process across the entire image. By incorporating attention mechanisms, the model can focus on regions of interest and adaptively modify the denoising steps, thereby improving accuracy and efficiency in tasks such as semantic segmentation or object detection.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a hybrid diffusion model that combines elements of both traditional and conditional diffusion processes, tailored specifically for dense prediction tasks. This model would leverage conditional generation strategies to better handle the spatial dependencies and detailed features required in tasks like semantic segmentation.",
