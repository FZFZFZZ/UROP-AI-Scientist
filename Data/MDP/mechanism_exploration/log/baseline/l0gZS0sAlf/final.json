  "target_idea": "Propose the Ensembles of Low-Rank Expert Adapters (ELREA) framework, which clusters training instructions based on gradient directions to reduce conflicts during optimization. Expert adapters are trained on these clusters using the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique for efficiency and scalability. During inference, ELREA combines predictions from the most relevant expert adapters based on input data's gradient similarity to the training clusters.",
  "context": "The training and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often involve diverse textual data from multiple sources, which poses challenges due to conflicting gradient directions, hindering optimization and specialization. These challenges can undermine model generalization across tasks, resulting in reduced downstream performance. Recent research suggests that fine-tuning LLMs on carefully selected, task-specific subsets of data can match or even surpass the performance of using the entire dataset.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic data curation protocol where the language model itself assists in selecting the optimal training subsets via a self-assessment mechanism. This protocol would work by initially exposing the model to a broad dataset and then using its internal representations to identify areas of conflict or uncertainty in the data, directing the data curation process to focus on these critical areas for subsequent training phases. This method would enable the model to iteratively refine its understanding and effectiveness on specific tasks by dynamically optimizing its own training curriculum and addressing the root causes of conflicting gradients directly.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a meta-learning framework where each specialized model is not only fine-tuned on distinct clusters but also learns to dynamically weigh its contribution to the final prediction based on the specific task requirements and data characteristics.",
