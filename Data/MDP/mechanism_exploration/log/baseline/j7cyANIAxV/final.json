  "target_idea": "Propose a similarity aware evaluation framework with a novel split methodology that adapts to any desired distribution. This is achieved through optimization problems solved by gradient descent, allowing for more accurate assessment of model performance on diverse sample similarities.",
  "context": "Drug-target binding affinity prediction is crucial for drug discovery and has been widely studied, yielding promising results. However, conventional evaluation methods, which use a randomized split of test sets, often result in test samples that are too similar to the training set. This leads to misleading performance metrics, as models struggle with samples that have lower similarity to the training set, a problem that is frequently overlooked.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a temporal-based split methodology for training and testing datasets in drug-target binding affinity prediction where data is divided based on the chronological order of drug discovery or reporting. This approach would simulate a more realistic scenario where future predictions are made on drug targets that do not share temporal data with the training set, better mimicking real-world situations where entirely new drug molecules are tested. Additionally, incorporate temporal features directly into the model to leverage the progression and evolution in drug design and target characteristics over time, potentially revealing more robust and generalizable insights about drug-target interactions.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a cross-validation scheme where each fold is designed with a controlled degree of dissimilarity, ensuring that every model is validated against both similar and dissimilar drug-target pairs, thus providing a more robust measure of model performance.",
