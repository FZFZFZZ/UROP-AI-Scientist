  "target_idea": "Propose LLMCert-B, a framework that certifies LLMs for counterfactual bias by providing high-confidence bounds on the probability of unbiased responses for any set of counterfactual prompts, which are prompts differing by demographic groups. This certification is applied to distributions of counterfactual prompts created using prefixes sampled from various prefix distributions, including random token sequences and perturbations in the LLM's embedding space.",
  "context": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate biased responses, leading to representational harms. Traditional methods for evaluating biases in LLM responses across different demographic groups, known as counterfactual bias, are inadequate as they do not scale well with a large number of inputs and lack guarantees.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an automated, continuous monitoring system that uses machine learning to dynamically adapt and refine a diverse dataset of counterfactuals. This system will leverage active learning to identify and prioritize the generation of new counterfactuals where the model's performance indicates high uncertainty or potential bias. By continuously updating the dataset and model evaluations, this approach can effectively scale with the increasing size and complexity of LLMs while ensuring more robust and up-to-date bias assessments.",
  "final_idea": "Develop an automated tool that leverages machine learning techniques to dynamically generate and test counterfactual scenarios across diverse demographics, thus scaling bias evaluation for LLMs efficiently and effectively.",
