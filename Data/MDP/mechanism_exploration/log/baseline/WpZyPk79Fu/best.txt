Best idea:
Create a cross-validation mechanism where preference data generated by one set of AI agents is independently evaluated by another set. This process not only checks for consistency and reliability but also mitigates biases by ensuring that the evaluation agents do not share the same training data or algorithmic structures as the generating agents.
