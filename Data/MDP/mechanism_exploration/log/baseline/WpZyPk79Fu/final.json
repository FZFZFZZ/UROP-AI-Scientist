  "target_idea": "Propose Anyprefer, a framework that synthesizes high-quality preference data by framing the data synthesis process as a cooperative two-player Markov Game involving a target model and a judge model. Introduce external tools to assist the judge model in accurately rewarding the target modelâ€™s responses and implement a feedback mechanism to optimize prompts for both models, enhancing collaboration and improving data quality.",
  "context": "High-quality preference data is crucial for aligning foundation models with human values through preference learning. Manual annotation of such data is often time-consuming and costly. Recent methods that allow models to generate and annotate their own preference data can lead to inaccuracies due to shared weights between the reward model and the target model, which amplifies inherent biases.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a collaborative filtering system utilizing a diverse array of disconnected AI agents to generate and evaluate preference data. Each agent, trained with distinct datasets and algorithms, votes on preference outcomes, addressing biases by incorporating a wide range of perspectives and methodologies. This \"ensemble learning\" method ensures any single agent's biases are mitigated by the collective intelligence and diverse assessments of the group, enhancing the objectivity and quality of the preference data used for training foundation models.",
  "final_idea": "Create a cross-validation mechanism where preference data generated by one set of AI agents is independently evaluated by another set. This process not only checks for consistency and reliability but also mitigates biases by ensuring that the evaluation agents do not share the same training data or algorithmic structures as the generating agents.",
