Best idea:
Develop a meta-learning framework for language model agents, where the agent not only evolves its prompts based on immediate task feedback but also incorporates a memory module. This module would allow it to store, recall, and effectively utilize strategies and patterns from previously solved tasks. Additionally, integrate reinforcement learning for the agent to periodically explore new strategies and decision paths, thus enhancing its adaptability and efficiency over diverse tasks.
