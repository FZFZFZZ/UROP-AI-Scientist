  "target_idea": "Introduce DoT (Diversity of Thoughts), a framework that reduces redundant reflections to improve decision-space exploration and incorporates a task-agnostic memory component for knowledge retrieval from previously solved tasks, enhancing the agent's performance across various reasoning tasks.",
  "context": "A common method for developing agents with Language Models involves iteratively prompting the model, reflecting on its outputs, and updating the prompts until the task is completed. However, this approach faces challenges such as limited exploration of the decision space due to repetitive reflections and an inability to utilize insights from previously solved tasks.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning framework for language model agents, where the agent not only evolves its prompts based on immediate task feedback but also incorporates a memory module. This module would allow it to store, recall, and effectively utilize strategies and patterns from previously solved tasks. Additionally, integrate reinforcement learning for the agent to periodically explore new strategies and decision paths, thus enhancing its adaptability and efficiency over diverse tasks.",
