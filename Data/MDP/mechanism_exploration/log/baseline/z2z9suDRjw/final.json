  "target_idea": "Introduce GOAL, a generalist model capable of efficiently solving multiple COPs, featuring a single backbone with light-weight problem-specific adapters for input and output processing. GOAL employs mixed-attention blocks to handle graph-based problems with various node, edge, and instance-level features, and uses a novel multi-type transformer architecture to manage heterogeneous node or edge types.",
  "context": "Machine Learning-based heuristics have demonstrated impressive performance in solving hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However, these approaches typically require a separate, specialized neural model for each problem, necessitating model adjustments and re-training for any problem variation.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning framework that trains a single, adaptable neural model capable of generating problem-specific heuristics for a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. This framework would utilize transfer learning and few-shot learning techniques to fine-tune the model on new problem types using minimal examples. By leveraging shared structures and similarities across different COPs, the model can quickly adapt to new problems, significantly reducing the need for individual model re-training.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a hierarchical learning approach where a base neural network learns generic features across multiple COPs, and specialized sub-networks learn problem-specific nuances. This structure allows the base network to handle broad aspects of COPs while the sub-networks adapt to specific problem constraints and objectives using fewer training examples.",
