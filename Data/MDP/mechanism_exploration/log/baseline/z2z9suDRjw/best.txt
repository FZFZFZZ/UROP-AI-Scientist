Best idea:
Introduce a hierarchical learning approach where a base neural network learns generic features across multiple COPs, and specialized sub-networks learn problem-specific nuances. This structure allows the base network to handle broad aspects of COPs while the sub-networks adapt to specific problem constraints and objectives using fewer training examples.
