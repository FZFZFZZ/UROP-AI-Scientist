  "target_idea": "Introduce Vision-LSTM (ViL), an adaptation of xLSTM for computer vision, consisting of a stack of xLSTM blocks that alternately process sequences of patch tokens from top to bottom and bottom to top.",
  "context": "Transformers have become a standard backbone in computer vision, although they were originally designed for natural language processing. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture has been recently enhanced to a more scalable and efficient version known as xLSTM, which addresses traditional LSTM limitations through exponential gating and a parallelizable matrix memory structure.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid neural network model that integrates the xLSTM with transformer-based image encoders to enhance sequence prediction in video understanding. This model would use the xLSTMâ€™s efficient temporal dynamic handling to process time-series data extracted by transformers from video frames, enabling superior performance in tasks such as future frame prediction and action recognition. The parallelizable matrix memory structure of xLSTM could be specifically optimized to handle the spatial-temporal features extracted by transformers, providing a state-of-the-art approach for real-time video analytics.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a hierarchical xLSTM architecture where multiple layers of xLSTMs process increasingly abstract features, then integrate these with transformer-encoded contextual data to enhance object recognition in high-density environments.",
