  "target_idea": "Introduce MetaMetrics, a calibrated meta-metric that optimizes the combination of existing metrics to better align with human preferences across different modalities in a supervised manner, enhancing their applicability in language and vision tasks.",
  "context": "Evaluating the quality of performance metrics is essential to ensure that model outputs align with human preferences. However, existing metrics often excel in specific areas but fail to capture the full range of human preferences, necessitating a systematic approach to calibrate metrics to these diverse aspects.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning framework that leverages user feedback to dynamically adjust and calibrate performance metrics for AI models across different domains. The framework would use a combination of reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization to iteratively refine metric weights and parameters based on discrepancies between predicted outcomes and user-reported satisfaction. This approach ensures that the calibrated metrics continually evolve to better align with the complexities and nuances of human preferences across varying contexts and applications.",
  "final_idea": "Develop an ensemble approach where multiple performance metrics are integrated and weighted according to their relevance and accuracy in reflecting human preferences. This system could use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and identify the most effective metric combinations for various application scenarios.",
