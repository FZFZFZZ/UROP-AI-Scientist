  "target_idea": "Propose Fiddler, a resource-efficient inference system for MoE models that optimally utilizes both CPU and GPU resources by determining the best execution strategy for environments with limited GPU resources.",
  "context": "Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have demonstrated strong performance across various tasks. However, their large model sizes pose challenges in resource-constrained environments, particularly where GPU memory is limited. Existing solutions attempt to leverage CPU resources but often encounter issues such as significant data transfer overhead between CPU and GPU or fail to account for the distinct characteristics of these processors.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid memory management system that dynamically partitions and allocates the active experts in an MoE model between GPU and CPU based on current computational load and memory availability. This system could use machine learning to predict which segments of the model will be most active in upcoming tasks and transfer them preemptively to the GPU to minimize data transfer overhead, while less critical or inactive segments are kept compressed in the CPU memory. Additionally, implement asynchronous and incremental loading/unloading mechanisms that adjust resource allocation in real-time, reducing latency and maintaining computational throughput despite hardware constraints.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a hybrid execution framework that allows MoE models to offload certain layers or operations selectively to the CPU or GPU based on their specific computational characteristics and memory demands, thereby enhancing overall system performance.",
