  "target_idea": "Propose SEQUOIA, an RL algorithm that optimizes long-term reward over feasible action spaces by embedding a Q-network into a mixed-integer program to select combinatorial actions at each timestep, specifically addressing planning over restless bandits with combinatorial actions.",
  "context": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used for real-world planning problems, especially in handling large state spaces and time horizons. However, a significant challenge arises when RL methods encounter large, combinatorially structured action spaces, where even representing feasible actions at a single step can require complex discrete optimization.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid reinforcement learning framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) to intelligently encode combinatorially structured action spaces. The GNN would learn to represent various feasible actions as nodes in a graph, utilizing edge connections to define relationships and constraints among actions. This approach allows the RL agent to exploit the structured representation for efficient policy learning, especially in dynamically evolving environments where action relationships and feasibilities change over time.",
  "final_idea": "Integrate deep learning models with mixed-integer programming within the RL framework to learn embeddings of the action spaces that simplify the combinatorial optimization problem, potentially reducing the computational overhead.",
