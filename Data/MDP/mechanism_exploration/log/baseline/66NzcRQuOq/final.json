  "target_idea": "Introduce a unified pyramidal flow matching algorithm that reinterprets the denoising trajectory as pyramid stages, with only the final stage at full resolution. This design allows for interlinked flows across stages to maintain continuity and supports autoregressive video generation with a temporal pyramid, enabling end-to-end optimization with a single unified Diffusion Transformer (DiT).",
  "context": "Video generation involves navigating a complex spatiotemporal space, which requires substantial computational resources and data. Current methods use a cascaded architecture to manage this complexity by avoiding direct training with full resolution latent, but this approach limits knowledge sharing and flexibility due to the separate optimization of each sub-stage.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a unified end-to-end trainable framework for video generation that employs a hierarchical, multi-resolution dynamic graph. Each node in this graph represents a different resolution and temporal segment of the video, dynamically interacting based on their spatial and temporal context. This method enables flexible, efficient learning and generation by optimizing all parts of the video in a coordinated manner, reducing redundancy and computational load while improving the semantic coherence between frames.",
