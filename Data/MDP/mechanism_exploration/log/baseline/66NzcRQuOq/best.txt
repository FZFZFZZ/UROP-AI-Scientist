Develop a unified end-to-end trainable framework for video generation that employs a hierarchical, multi-resolution dynamic graph. Each node in this graph represents a different resolution and temporal segment of the video, dynamically interacting based on their spatial and temporal context. This method enables flexible, efficient learning and generation by optimizing all parts of the video in a coordinated manner, reducing redundancy and computational load while improving the semantic coherence between frames.
