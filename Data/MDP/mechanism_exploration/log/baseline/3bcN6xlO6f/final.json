  "target_idea": "Introduce Video Action Differencing (VidDiff), a method that addresses the task by breaking it into three stages: action difference proposal, keyframe localization, and frame differencing, each utilizing specialized foundation models. A benchmark dataset, VidDiffBench, is also created to support development in this area.",
  "context": "Identifying subtle differences between videos of the same action is a challenging task with applications in areas like coaching and skill learning. Existing large multimodal models struggle with this task, particularly in localizing relevant sub-actions and performing fine-grained frame comparisons.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hierarchical attention-based neural network model that processes video sequences at multiple scales. The model would have two layers of attention mechanisms: one targeting short sequences to identify and prioritize fine-grained actions and another focusing on broader sequence patterns to understand context and progression. This structure allows the model to dynamically adjust the focus between detailed movement analysis and overall action flow, improving the ability to differentiate subtle variations in similar activities across videos.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a modular Siamese network where each module specializes in different aspects of the video, such as motion dynamics, spatial relationships, and temporal progression, to comprehensively analyze and compare the subtleties in actions.",
