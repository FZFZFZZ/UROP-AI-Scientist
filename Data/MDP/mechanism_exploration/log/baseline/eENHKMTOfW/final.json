  "target_idea": "Conduct a comprehensive study on supervised fine-tuning of small-sized LLMs (3B to 7B parameters) using instruction-tuning datasets across diverse domains. The study explores various training configurations and strategies on open-source pre-trained models, providing detailed documentation and challenging common training practices to offer guidance for practitioners.",
  "context": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has led to a significant gap between industrial research labs, which have the resources to fine-tune these models, and individual developers or small organizations, who lack the necessary resources to explore the experiment space effectively. This disparity is due to the high computational demands and expertise required for fine-tuning LLMs.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a decentralized, peer-to-peer platform for sharing computational resources and model insights specifically tailored for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Individual developers and small organizations can contribute their unused computing power, like a digital co-op, and in return, they gain credits or tokens which can be used to run their own LLM experiments or access pre-fine-tuned models shared by others. This platform could utilize federated learning techniques to ensure data privacy and model security while facilitating collaborative improvement and customization of LLMs across diverse use cases and domains.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a standardized fine-tuning protocol, endorsed by leading AI research institutions, that provides a step-by-step guide for efficient resource management and model optimization tailored to the needs of smaller labs and individual developers.",
