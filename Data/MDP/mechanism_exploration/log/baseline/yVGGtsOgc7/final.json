  "target_idea": "The study provides theoretical and experimental results that guarantee the emergence of disentangled representations in agents solving multi-task classification tasks. It introduces conditions under which these representations emerge, based on noise, number of tasks, and evidence accumulation time, and offers closed-form expressions for extracting them from the model's latent state. The framework is validated in RNNs and shows robustness across various architectures, with transformers being particularly effective for disentangling representations.",
  "context": "Intelligent perception and interaction with the world depend on internal representations that capture its underlying structure, known as disentangled or abstract representations. These representations isolate latent factors of variation in the world, facilitating feature-based generalization. The challenge lies in ensuring the emergence of such representations in systems that solve multi-task evidence accumulation classification tasks, which are common in neuroscience.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a computational model that mimics the process of synaptic pruning in human neural development to evolve disentangled representations for multi-task learning. The model would begin with an over-parameterized neural network and, through a series of tasks, selectively prune connections based on their redundancy and the clarity of their contribution to task-specific representations. This biologically inspired approach allows the system to not only refine its internal architecture, but also to enhance its ability to generalize from complex, multi-task environments by forging clearer, more abstract representations of inputs.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a variational autoencoder framework with task-specific regularization terms to enforce the separation of latent factors, enhancing the model's ability to learn disentangled representations that are robust across multiple classification tasks.",
