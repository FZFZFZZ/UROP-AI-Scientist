Best idea:
Develop a synthetic data generation framework for MLLMs that uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create realistic math-related diagrams and corresponding textual descriptions. This framework would automatically generate diverse math diagrams (e.g., geometry figures, algebraic graphs) along with natural language problems and detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Leveraging the adversarial nature, the framework would iteratively refine the diagram-text alignment and the linguistic quality of explanations, thereby generating a large-scale, high-quality dataset for training MLLMs without the extensive cost of manual creation.
