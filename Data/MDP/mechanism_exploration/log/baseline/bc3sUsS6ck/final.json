  "target_idea": "Introduce GenerativeAdapter, a method that encodes test-time context into language model parameters with a single forward pass. It augments a frozen pretrained LM with a lightweight adapter generator, trained via self-supervised learning, to produce parameter-efficient adapters. The generator is general-purpose, capable of adapting the base model for all language processing scenarios.",
  "context": "Large language models (LLMs) acquire substantial knowledge during pretraining but often require adaptation to new contexts, tasks, or domains. This adaptation is typically achieved through fine-tuning, which incurs significant training costs, or prompting, which increases inference overhead.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a method for real-time adaptive learning for LLMs that uses a lightweight decision-making module to automatically choose between pre-trained model outputs, fine-tuned models, and dynamically generated prompts based on the incoming query's complexity, domain specificity, and historical response effectiveness. This module would use meta-learning principles to continuously update its decision criteria based on feedback loops that evaluate the success of previous decisions in response to similar queries. This approach aims to optimize computational efficiency and accuracy without the need for extensive retraining or excessive reliance on large-scale prompts.",
  "final_idea": "Investigate the efficiency of lightweight, task-specific tuning layers that overlay the core LLM architecture, facilitating rapid adaptation while maintaining the underlying model's integrity and reducing computational overhead.",
