  "target_idea": "Propose a framework that enhances HGNNs by employing a teacher-student knowledge distillation strategy, where a teacher model transfers both soft labels and structural information to a lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) called TinyGCN, enabling faster inference and reduced computational cost while maintaining accuracy.",
  "context": "Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are known for their high accuracy in capturing complex dependencies in data. However, they often suffer from slow inference speeds and high memory consumption, which limits their applicability in real-time scenarios.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic pruning algorithm for Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) that adaptively removes less significant hyperedges and nodes during the inference phase based on real-time performance metrics. This algorithm would utilize a reinforcement learning framework where the agent learns an optimal pruning policy to balance accuracy and inference speed, adjusting the network's complexity according to the computational constraints and latency requirements of the application. This approach can significantly reduce memory usage and accelerate inference times, making HGNNs more feasible for real-time applications.",
  "final_idea": "Leverage knowledge distillation where a smaller, more efficient student HGNN is trained to mimic a larger, pre-trained teacher HGNN, aiming to retain most of the accuracy while being more suitable for real-time applications due to reduced computational demands.",
