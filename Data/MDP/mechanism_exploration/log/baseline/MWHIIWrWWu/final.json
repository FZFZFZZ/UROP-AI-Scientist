  "target_idea": "Introduce Model Predictive Control with Morphology-aware Proportional Control (MPC$^2$), a hierarchical model-based learning algorithm designed for zero-shot and near-real-time control of high-dimensional complex dynamical systems. MPC$^2$ employs a sampling-based model predictive controller for target posture planning and incorporates a morphology-aware proportional controller for actuator coordination, facilitating robust control in high-dimensional tasks.",
  "context": "Controlling high-dimensional nonlinear systems, such as those in biological and robotic applications, is difficult due to the large state and action spaces involved. Although deep reinforcement learning has been successful in these areas, it is often computationally demanding and time-consuming, making it unsuitable for handling large sets of tasks that require extensive manual tuning.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive meta-learning algorithm for reinforcement learning that specifically targets high-dimensional nonlinear systems. This algorithm would use a small, diverse set of \"meta-tasks\" derived from commonalities in biological and robotic systems to learn a generalized policy initialization. This initialization could then be quickly adapted to new tasks using fewer computational resources and less manual tuning, thereby improving efficiency and scalability in real-world applications.",
  "final_idea": "Utilize advanced model predictive control within the reinforcement learning framework to provide real-time optimization based on predicted future states, improving control accuracy and reducing the reliance on extensive training datasets.",
