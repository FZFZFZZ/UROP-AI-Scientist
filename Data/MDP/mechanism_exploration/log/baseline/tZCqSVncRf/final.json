  "target_idea": "Introduce 'Mirage', a synthetic dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' inductive and deductive reasoning abilities with flexible variations in input distribution, task scenarios, and difficulty levels, to better analyze factors affecting LLMs' reasoning processes.",
  "context": "Inductive reasoning is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to enhance their intelligence, requiring them to generalize rules from observed facts and apply them to new examples. Previous work in this area has been limited by inadequate evaluation and inflexible test data, hindering a comprehensive understanding of LLMs' reasoning capabilities.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic evaluation framework for LLMs where the system itself generates new test cases based on its understanding of inductive rules derived from initial training data. This self-generated test set should not only challenge the model on rule consistency and extrapolation but also evolve over time based on the model's performance, identifying and addressing weaknesses in the LLM's reasoning abilities. This approach will simulate a more realistic scenario where LLMs encounter ever-changing information, thus better assessing their ability to adapt and generalize inductive reasoning over time.",
  "final_idea": "Explore the use of synthetic data generation techniques to create a highly diverse range of logical structures and rules within the benchmark dataset, ensuring that the LLMs are tested against a broad spectrum of inductive reasoning challenges.",
