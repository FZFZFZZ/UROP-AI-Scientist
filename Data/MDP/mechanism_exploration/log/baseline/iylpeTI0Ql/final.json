  "target_idea": "Introduce Zero-Shot Noisy TTA (ZS-NTTA), a framework that decouples the classifier and detector, focusing on developing an individual detector while keeping the classifier frozen. The Adaptive Noise Detector (AdaND) is proposed, which uses the frozen model's outputs as pseudo-labels to train a noise detector, effectively identifying noisy samples. Additionally, Gaussian noise is injected during adaptation to prevent misclassification of clean samples as noisy.",
  "context": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) is designed to handle distribution shifts between source and target data by using only target data during testing. In open-world scenarios, models frequently encounter noisy samples that fall outside the in-distribution label space, which poses a challenge for existing TTA methods. These methods often experience a significant performance drop when dealing with noisy samples, as the negative impact of unfiltered noisy data can outweigh the benefits of clean data during model updating.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a test-time adaptation framework that employs a dynamic filtering mechanism based on reinforcement learning. In this setup, an agent learns to differentiate between noise and signal in the target data dynamically, rewarding decisions that retain and utilize beneficial datapoints while penalizing the retention of noisy outliers. This reinforcement model can adjust to varying degrees and types of noise in real-time, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of TTA methods in open-world scenarios with minimal human supervision.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a self-supervised learning component for the TTA model that generates pseudo-labels for target data, using these labels to train a noise discriminator. This discriminator can then be used to refine the adaptation process by focusing on data samples that are most likely to represent the true target distribution.",
