  "target_idea": "Introduce a specialized dataset generation approach optimized for audio generation and transformation tasks, revealing meaningful relationships between audio and language. Additionally, propose ComposableART, an inference-time technique that extends classifier-free guidance to compositional guidance, enabling flexible composition of instructions for customizable audio outputs.",
  "context": "Large language models (LLMs) trained on text can infer instructions directly from data, but models trained solely on audio data lack this capability because audio data does not inherently contain the instructions used to generate it. This presents a challenge in creating audio synthesis and transformation models that can follow free-form text instructions.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid training approach where an LLM trained on text and a model trained on audio data are jointly fine-tuned with an audio-text alignment module. This module would use a self-supervised learning strategy to correlate specific sounds or audio features with corresponding textual instructions without explicit paired examples. The system would progressively learn to generate or transform audio in response to text instructions by discovering and reinforcing these inferred correlations during training.",
  "final_idea": "Integrate a cross-modal embedding space in the training architecture, where embeddings from text and audio data are mapped into a shared latent space. This approach can facilitate the learning of intricate relationships between text and audio features, using techniques like contrastive learning to enhance the alignment and improve the model's ability to generate audio based on text instructions.",
