Best idea:
Integrate a cross-modal embedding space in the training architecture, where embeddings from text and audio data are mapped into a shared latent space. This approach can facilitate the learning of intricate relationships between text and audio features, using techniques like contrastive learning to enhance the alignment and improve the model's ability to generate audio based on text instructions.
