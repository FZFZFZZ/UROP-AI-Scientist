Best idea:
Introduce a sparsity-inducing regularization technique in the training of generative models within federated learning frameworks. By promoting sparsity in the parameter updates that are communicated, this method would reduce the size of the data transmitted between nodes, addressing high communication costs while maintaining privacy and accommodating data heterogeneity.
