  "target_idea": "Introduce Phidias, a novel generative model that uses diffusion for reference-augmented 3D generation, leveraging a retrieved or user-provided 3D reference model to guide the process. It integrates meta-ControlNet for dynamic conditioning, dynamic reference routing to address misalignment, and self-reference augmentations for self-supervised training.",
  "context": "Generative 3D modeling has recently advanced but faces challenges due to its inherently ill-posed nature, affecting quality and controllability. Designers often refer to existing 3D models when creating new ones, highlighting the need for improved methods in 3D generation.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a generative adversarial network (GAN) specifically tailored for 3D model synthesis that incorporates a style transfer mechanism. This network would learn stylistic elements from a database of high-quality 3D models and apply these styles to basic structural forms generated from user specifications or random seeds. By enabling style customization in the generative process, the system ensures higher quality and distinctive design outcomes, enhancing both the creative capabilities and controllability for designers.",
  "final_idea": "Design a GAN that integrates with a database of 3D models, using transfer learning to adapt features from similar objects in the database to new creations, enhancing the speed and accuracy of model generation.",
