  "target_idea": "Introduce the Process Q-value Model (PQM), a new framework that redefines PRM within a Markov Decision Process context. PQM optimizes Q-value rankings using a novel comparative loss function, improving the model's ability to capture the complex dynamics among sequential decisions.",
  "context": "Process Reward Modeling (PRM) is essential for tasks involving complex reasoning and decision-making, where the accuracy of each intermediate step significantly impacts the final outcome. Current PRM methods, typically treated as classification problems, use cross-entropy loss to evaluate each step's correctness independently. This approach can result in suboptimal reward distribution and fails to adequately consider the interdependencies between steps.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hierarchical reward modeling framework that utilizes graph neural networks to capture the interdependencies between various steps in a process. In this model, each node represents a decision or action step, and edges encode dependencies and influence among these nodes. This approach not only allows for a more nuanced understanding of how actions influence each other but also adaptively allocates rewards based on the overall impact of sequences of actions on the final outcome, thus potentially increasing the fidelity and efficacy of process reward distributions.",
  "final_idea": "Apply a hybrid model combining deep learning for feature extraction from each step with a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to evaluate the sequential dependencies and optimize the reward distribution, enhancing the model's ability to handle complex, multi-step scenarios.",
