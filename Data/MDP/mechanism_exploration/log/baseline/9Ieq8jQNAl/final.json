  "target_idea": "Enable experimentation and evaluation of multi-type feedback by generating high-quality simulated feedback of six different types, implementing reward models, and conducting downstream RL training across various environments to compare with preference-based baselines.",
  "context": "Learning rewards from preference feedback is crucial for aligning agentic models, typically using binary comparisons between multiple completions to gather large-scale human feedback. However, human feedback is often more diverse in other contexts, which can better support annotator goals and provide mutually informative insights or reveal biases in the reward learning process. Despite these advantages, the exploration of learning from diverse feedback types remains limited.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid feedback model that combines structured scalable feedback, such as pairwise comparisons, with unstructured feedback inputs including free-form text annotations, video reactions, and emotional responses captured via biometric sensors. This model would employ multimodal machine learning techniques to interpret and integrate these diverse data types into a cohesive reward system. The system would dynamically adjust the weighting of different feedback modalities based on their predictive power and reliability in improving model alignment with human values and behaviors.",
  "final_idea": "Create a simulation environment to test the impact of integrating diverse feedback types on reward model performance. This simulated testing could provide insights into potential pitfalls and advantages of various integration strategies before they are deployed in real-world settings, reducing the risk of misalignment.",
