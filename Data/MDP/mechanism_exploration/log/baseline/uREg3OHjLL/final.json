  "target_idea": "Investigate ReLU networks with decimal fraction weights, demonstrating that $F_n$ requires at least $\\lceil \\log_3 (n+1) \\rceil$ hidden layers. Additionally, for networks with $N$-ary fraction weights, establish a lower bound of $\\Omega( \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\ln N})$ layers, partially confirming the conjecture for rational ReLU networks.",
  "context": "The expressive power of ReLU neural networks is believed to increase with their depth. A specific function, $F_n = \\max (0,x_1,\\ldots,x_n )$, has been used to explore this relationship. A conjecture suggested that any ReLU network exactly representing $F_n$ requires at least $\\lceil \\log_2 (n+1) \\rceil$ hidden layers, a claim recently confirmed for networks with integer weights.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid ReLU-adaptive activation function neural network that can dynamically adjust its activation functions based on the input's complexity and structure. This network would start with standard ReLU and, through a reinforcement learning-based meta-learning layer, adaptively switch to variants of ReLU (e.g., Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU) or entirely different functions that provide better performance for specific input types or segments of the data. This could potentially reduce the depth needed to approximate complex functions like $F_n$, making networks more efficient both in terms of computational resources and accuracy.",
  "final_idea": "Investigate the role of weight precision in ReLU networks by evaluating how varying levels of decimal precision in weights affect the minimum network depth required to represent functions such as $F_n$, and compare these findings with those of integer-weight networks.",
