  "target_idea": "Develop a piano-hand motion generation benchmark to guide hand movements and fingerings, using an annotated dataset called PianoMotion10M, which includes 116 hours of piano playing videos with 10 million annotated hand poses. Introduce a baseline model that generates hand motions from audio using a position predictor and a position-guided gesture generator, along with evaluation metrics to assess model performance.",
  "context": "Artificial intelligence techniques are increasingly being applied in education, yet designing effective systems for music instrument instruction, particularly for piano, remains challenging. While key presses can be derived from sheet music, the transitional movements between these presses require more detailed guidance for effective piano performance.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a deep learning-based virtual piano tutor that utilizes a combination of motion capture technology and generative adversarial networks (GANs). The system would track and analyze the user's hand and finger movements in real-time using motion sensors. It then compares these movements against an optimal model generated by the GAN, which has learned from a dataset of expert pianists, providing immediate personalized feedback and suggestions for improvement on movement fluidity, timing, and technique.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a 3D motion capture system to track the detailed movements of pianists' hands and fingers, using this data to train a deep neural network that can predict optimal finger placements and transitions for various piano pieces.",
