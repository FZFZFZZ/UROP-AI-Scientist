  "target_idea": "Propose a new convergence analysis for Adam that leverages the smoothness of loss under the ℓ∞-geometry, rather than the traditional ℓ2-geometry, resulting in a better empirical smoothness constant for models like GPT-2 and ResNet. Extend this analysis to blockwise Adam with novel blockwise smoothness assumptions.",
  "context": "Adam optimizer is known to outperform Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in training language models, but the theoretical understanding of this advantage is limited. Previous analyses of convergence for both Adam and SGD have focused on the number of steps and have been optimal in non-convex scenarios, with both achieving a convergence rate of approximately O(T^-1/4).",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid optimization algorithm that intelligently switches between SGD and Adam during the training of language models based on the curvature of the loss landscape. By employing real-time curvature analysis, the algorithm could utilize SGD in flatter regions for stability and Adam in steeper regions for efficient traversal of sharp gradients. This approach could provide both faster convergence and a deeper theoretical understanding of how different optimization dynamics benefit specific characteristics of the loss landscape during the training process.",
  "final_idea": "Propose a geometric approach to understanding the convergence of Adam and SGD by analyzing the trajectory of updates in a Riemannian manifold setting. This perspective could provide deeper insights into the dynamics of each optimizer in navigating complex loss landscapes.",
