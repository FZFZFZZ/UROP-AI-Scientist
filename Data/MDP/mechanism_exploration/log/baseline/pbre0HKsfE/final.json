  "target_idea": "Propose a modified transformer architecture that is compatible with homomorphic encryption, focusing on inference after personalized fine-tuning. This approach uses LoRA fine-tuning and Gaussian kernels to achieve substantial computational speedups while maintaining performance similar to models operating on plaintext data.",
  "context": "Large language models (LLMs) can generate personalized responses based on user interactions, but this capability raises significant privacy concerns. Homomorphic encryption (HE) offers a cryptographic solution for privacy-preserving machine learning by allowing computations on encrypted data. However, the computational demands of transformers make it challenging to apply HE to LLMs effectively.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid processing framework for LLMs where only the privacy-sensitive components of the model processing—such as embedding user-specific data—are performed under homomorphic encryption. Less sensitive, general computations like large-scale language model inference could then be processed in plaintext. This method would minimize the computational overhead associated with HE, whilst maintaining user privacy for the most critical elements of data processing.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a specialized set of lightweight transformer models specifically designed for use with homomorphic encryption, focusing on reducing model complexity and computational overhead while maintaining adequate performance for personalized responses.",
