  "target_idea": "Develop a Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA, by formulating Region-Centric tasks and constructing a large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct, to incorporate regional information into training. This model is designed to handle both image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across various modalities, enabling enhanced understanding of anatomical regions within medical scans.",
  "context": "Several medical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been developed to handle tasks involving visual images with textual instructions across various medical modalities. These models have achieved impressive results but are generally region-agnostic, treating the entire image as a holistic representation. This approach makes it difficult for the models to identify specific regions of focus when generating sentences, unlike doctors who review entire images before concentrating on specific regions for thorough evaluation.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates a dynamic attention mechanism modelled after human focal awareness in medical imaging. This model would use initial broad image scanning to identify potential regions of interest, leveraging a combination of convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures. After the initial scan, the model would apply an intensified secondary analysis to these specific areas before generating textual descriptions, potentially enhancing precision in identifying and describing pathological features relevant to the given medical context.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a region-based training protocol for MLLMs, where the model is specifically trained on segmented parts of medical images alongside full images, to improve its ability to distinguish and prioritize regions differently based on the clinical context provided in the textual instructions.",
