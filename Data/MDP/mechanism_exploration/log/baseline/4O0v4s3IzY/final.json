  "target_idea": "Conduct a systematic investigation into the effectiveness of iterative prompting for reasoning and planning, specifically examining GPT-4's performance in tasks like Game of 24, Graph Coloring, and STRIPS planning. The study explores both self-critique by the model and verification by an external reasoner, analyzing the impact of criticisms on performance and the effects of removing elements from the augmented system.",
  "context": "There is ongoing debate about the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Initial hopes that reasoning would naturally emerge with increased scale have been challenged by various counterexamples. Despite this, many believe LLMs can iteratively self-critique and improve their solutions, based on the assumption that verifying correctness is easier than generating solutions, a notion rooted in computational complexity.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dual-model architecture where one LLM specializes in solution generation and a second, distinct LLM specializes in critique and verification. The critique model is trained using a dataset of problems with known incorrect responses and corresponding expert commentary on the flaws, thus refining its ability to assess and improve solutions generated by the first model. This approach will enable ongoing dynamic interaction between generation and critique, potentially allowing each model to focus and excel in its respective domain, leading to enhanced reasoning and problem-solving capabilities in LLMs.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a meta-learning framework wherein an LLM iteratively updates its own training protocol based on feedback from a critique model. This meta-model can adjust its learning rate, focus on specific types of reasoning errors, and modify its training data composition based on performance metrics evaluated by the critique LLM.",
