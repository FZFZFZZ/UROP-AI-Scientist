  "target_idea": "Introduce DSBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate data science agents on realistic tasks, including 466 data analysis tasks and 74 data modeling tasks from Eloquence and Kaggle competitions, featuring long contexts, multimodal backgrounds, and complex data structures.",
  "context": "Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown significant capabilities in language and vision reasoning, leading to their use in specialized applications like shopping assistants and AI software engineers. Despite the development of various data science benchmarks to assess their performance, these benchmarks often fail to reflect the complexity of real-world data science tasks due to their oversimplified nature.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic benchmark for LLMs and LVLMs that evolves with user feedback and task performance, simulating real-world volatility and complexity. This could involve a system where models are continuously evaluated against a stream of incoming data from various sources (e.g., social media, news outlets, academic articles) that changes in real-time based on current events, technology advancements, and cultural shifts. The benchmark would automatically adjust its metrics and tasks based on these real-time data flows and aggregate global user feedback, providing a more authentic measure of the model's ability to handle real-world tasks across different domains.",
  "final_idea": "Create a benchmark that not only assesses the accuracy of LLMs and LVLMs in data interpretation but also evaluates their efficiency and scalability when processing large-scale, heterogeneous datasets from real-world scenarios.",
