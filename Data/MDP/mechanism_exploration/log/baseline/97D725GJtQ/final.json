  "target_idea": "Propose a semi-supervised training method called SemiCLIP that enhances CLIP's cross-modal alignment by using a small amount of image-text pairs and a large volume of images without text. Introduce semantic concept mining to improve visual representations by matching images with relevant concepts from labeled data, and construct learnable surrogate captions for unlabeled images to optimize a trapezoidal consistency in the representation space.",
  "context": "Vision-language pre-training models like CLIP have shown strong adaptability to downstream tasks through fine-tuning and are widely used across various applications. However, these models face challenges when downstream tasks have limited image-text paired data, making it difficult to bridge the domain gap between pre-training and target tasks.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a method of zero-shot domain adaptation for vision-language models by integrating unsupervised data augmentation techniques. The model, starting from its pre-trained state, generates synthetic image-text pairs from unlabelled data in the target domain using generative adversarial networks (GANs). This method would seamlessly adapt the model to new domains without requiring expensive labeled datasets, enhancing its flexibility and reducing the dependency on domain-specific data.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a semi-supervised learning framework that combines few-shot learning with unsupervised data augmentation for vision-language models. This approach leverages a small amount of labeled data in the target domain alongside a larger pool of unlabeled data, using consistency regularization to ensure robust domain adaptation.",
