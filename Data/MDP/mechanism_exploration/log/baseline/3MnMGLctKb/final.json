  "target_idea": "Introduce CellFlow for Generation (CFGen), a flow-based conditional generative model that maintains the discrete nature of single-cell data, enabling reliable generation of whole-genome, multi-modal, single-cell data. CFGen addresses generative tasks like rare cell type augmentation and batch correction, and includes a novel framework for compositional data generation using Flow Matching.",
  "context": "Generative modeling of single-cell RNA-seq data is essential for tasks such as trajectory inference, batch effect removal, and simulating realistic cellular data. Current deep generative models often use pre-processed continuous gene expression data, which fails to capture the discrete nature of single-cell data, limiting their effectiveness and the ability to incorporate robust noise models. Additionally, there is a lack of exploration in controllable multi-modal and multi-label generation of cellular data.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid generative model that combines graph-based neural networks with discrete latent variables to model the expression patterns of single cells more accurately. This model could use graph structures to capture the complex relationships among genes within and across cells while employing discrete latent spaces to represent distinct cellular states and types. By integrating mechanisms for mode-specific control, such as attention mechanisms or gating functions, this model could facilitate multi-modal generation and fine-grained adjustment of simulated cell types and states under varying experimental conditions.",
  "final_idea": "Integrate a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a discrete latent space specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data, which allows for the modeling of count-based distributions and incorporates dropout events as part of the generative process. This approach could enhance the model's ability to handle the inherent sparsity and over-dispersion in single-cell data, potentially improving the fidelity of trajectory inference and batch effect simulations.",
