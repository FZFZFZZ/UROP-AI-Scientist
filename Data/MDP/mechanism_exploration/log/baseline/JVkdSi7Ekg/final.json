  "target_idea": "Introduce AHA, an open-source vision-language model designed to detect and reason about failures in robotic manipulation using natural language. AHA frames failure detection as a free-form reasoning task, identifying failures and providing detailed, adaptable explanations across different robots, tasks, and environments. It is fine-tuned using FailGen, a scalable framework that generates a large-scale dataset of robotic failure trajectories, the AHA dataset.",
  "context": "Robotic manipulation in open-world settings requires not only task execution but also the ability to detect and learn from failures. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have improved robots' spatial reasoning and problem-solving abilities, but they still struggle with failure recognition, limiting their real-world applicability.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid AI model that integrates a vision-language model (VLM) with sensory feedback data for adaptive failure detection in robotic manipulation. The VLM would interpret visual and textual environmental data to predict potential manipulation outcomes, while embedded sensors in the robot's manipulators collect real-time tactile, force, and torque data. This multimodal approach allows the robot to dynamically adjust its strategy based on predictive discrepancies and actual sensory feedback, enhancing its ability to recognize and learn from failures in diverse real-world tasks.",
  "final_idea": "Integrate a context-aware diagnostic tool into robotic systems that leverages VLM and LLM outputs to not only predict but also explain potential failure points in a detailed, understandable manner for human operators.",
