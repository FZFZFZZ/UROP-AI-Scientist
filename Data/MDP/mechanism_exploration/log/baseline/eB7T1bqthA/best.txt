Best idea:
Develop a dual-objective optimization model for multi-armed bandits that integrates a cost minimization layer with a constraint on achieving a minimum threshold of reward, using a modified UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) algorithm that incorporates cost parameters into its confidence bounds.
