  "target_idea": "Propose a framework that focuses on identifying and modeling local patterns to generalize to novel samples, using a two-stage process of image-text alignment and cross-modality attention. Introduce a State Machine Module (SMM) to enhance local patterns with temporal clues, and employ temporal motion estimation to detect anomalies with unique spatial distributions or dynamics.",
  "context": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) seeks to identify new actions or events that were not observed during training. Current VAD methods often concentrate on global patterns with excessive details, which hampers their ability to generalize to unseen samples.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid VAD model that combines unsupervised learning with transfer learning, focusing on extracting abstract representations of actions and scenes. The model's unsupervised component learns to cluster video segments based on low-resolution, spatially blurred inputs to emphasize general motion and interaction patterns rather than specific details. Meanwhile, the transfer learning component uses pre-trained models on diverse datasets to embed a robust and generalizable feature set that helps the system adapt to new, unseen anomalies by recognizing deviations from learned abstract action norms.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a hierarchical approach in video anomaly detection by using convolutional neural networks to first extract local features and then aggregate them at various scales to capture both micro and macro anomalies effectively.",
