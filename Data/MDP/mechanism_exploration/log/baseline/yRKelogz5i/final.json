  "target_idea": "Develop a novel framework called CAUSM, which uses structured causal models to address sycophancy in LLMs by eliminating spurious correlations through causally motivated head reweighting and calibrating intra-head knowledge along the causal representation direction.",
  "context": "Incorporating user preferences into large language models (LLMs) can improve personalization and reliability, making them more applicable to real-world scenarios. However, this can lead to sycophancy, where LLMs prioritize user preferences over the correctness of their outputs due to reliance on spurious correlations.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dual-system language model architecture where one system is trained to optimize for accuracy and factual correctness while the second system focuses on aligning outputs with user preferences. During operation, a meta-controller assesses the appropriateness of aligning with user preferences based on the context of the query (e.g., factual inquiry vs. personal taste question) and dynamically adjusts the influence of each subsystem on the final output. This approach ensures that the model remains factually reliable while providing personalized responses when suitable.",
  "final_idea": "Utilize a context-aware adaptive learning protocol in LLMs that detects the type of query (subjective or objective) and adjusts the influence of user preferences accordingly, ensuring that factual content is prioritized when necessary.",
