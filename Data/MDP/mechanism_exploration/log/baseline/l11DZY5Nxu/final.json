  "target_idea": "Introduce In-Distribution Interventions (IDI), an algorithm that predicts root causes by identifying nodes with anomalous values and assessing if normalizing these values would prevent anomalies, using interventional estimates from in-distribution inputs of the fitted SCM.",
  "context": "Diagnosing the root cause of anomalies in complex interconnected systems is a significant challenge in cloud services and industrial operations. Traditional methods rely on counterfactuals derived from Structural Causal Models (SCMs) trained on historical data, which are unreliable due to the rarity of anomalies that fall outside the training distribution.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid anomaly detection system that leverages unsupervised deep learning models to adaptively identify new anomalies by analyzing deviations in operational patterns, alongside a reinforcement learning module that simulates various interventions in a digital twin of the environment. This system continually updates its understanding and improves its predictions based on feedback from both the operational impacts of suggested interventions and real-time data streams. This dynamic learning cycle helps pinpoint the root causes more accurately, even for anomalies not previously encountered.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a Bayesian network approach to model the causal relationships within the system, using a combination of expert knowledge and data-driven insights. This approach can update beliefs about causal structures in real-time as new data becomes available, potentially offering a more robust basis for generating counterfactuals that help identify the root causes of anomalies.",
