Employ a Bayesian network approach to model the causal relationships within the system, using a combination of expert knowledge and data-driven insights. This approach can update beliefs about causal structures in real-time as new data becomes available, potentially offering a more robust basis for generating counterfactuals that help identify the root causes of anomalies.
