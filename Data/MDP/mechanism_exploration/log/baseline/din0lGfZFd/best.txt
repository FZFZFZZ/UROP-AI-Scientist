Best idea:
Introduce a hierarchical looped architecture where reasoning is structured in tiers, each with increasing complexity and depth but using the same small parameter set. Each tier could refine the output from the previous one, allowing for a progressively deeper understanding without increasing the total number of parameters. This could be enhanced by employing a dynamic resource allocation system that adapts the depth of processing based on the complexity of the task at hand.
