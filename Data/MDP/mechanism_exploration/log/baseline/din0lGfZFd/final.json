  "target_idea": "Propose the use of looped models for reasoning tasks, where a $k$-layer transformer looped $L$ times can achieve performance comparable to a $kL$-layer non-looped model. This approach leverages iterative algorithms to solve reasoning problems effectively with optimal depth, and introduces a looping-based regularization to address both reasoning and memorization challenges.",
  "context": "Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, with scaling laws indicating that a large parameter count, particularly in terms of depth, is crucial. However, many reasoning tasks may require significant depth without necessarily needing a large number of parameters. This insight opens up new possibilities for applying looped models to reasoning tasks.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a looped architecture design for reasoning tasks which re-uses a relatively small set of parameters across multiple layers or stages. This model could process input through iterative refinement loops, where each loop adjusts intermediate representations slightly based on feedback from the output of previous iterations, thus deepening the reasoning capability without expanding the parameter count significantly. To optimize performance, incorporate adaptive gating mechanisms that decide how many iterations are needed for a given input, making the model efficient and dynamic in handling varying levels of complexity in reasoning tasks.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a hierarchical looped architecture where reasoning is structured in tiers, each with increasing complexity and depth but using the same small parameter set. Each tier could refine the output from the previous one, allowing for a progressively deeper understanding without increasing the total number of parameters. This could be enhanced by employing a dynamic resource allocation system that adapts the depth of processing based on the complexity of the task at hand.",
