  "target_idea": "Introduce SVBench, a new benchmark designed for evaluating streaming video understanding in LVLMs through temporal multi-turn question-answering chains. This includes a semi-automated annotation pipeline to create QA pairs and chains, enabling comprehensive assessment of LVLMs' capabilities in sustaining temporal reasoning over video streams.",
  "context": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress on established benchmarks, but there is a lack of suitable evaluation for their effectiveness in the emerging field of long-context streaming video understanding. Existing benchmarks focus on isolated single-instance text inputs and do not adequately assess the ability to maintain temporal reasoning over the duration of video streams.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a benchmark called \"StreamContext Challenge\" for evaluating LVLMs in long-context streaming video understanding. This involves creating datasets consisting of unedited, long-duration video streams (e.g., entire sports events, full-length documentaries) paired with a sequence of incrementally prompted questions that require the model to update and refine its responses as more information becomes available or as events unfold. The evaluation metric would focus on the model's ability to handle temporal dependencies, understand evolving narratives, and accurately integrate new information from ongoing video streams without losing coherence or context accuracy.",
