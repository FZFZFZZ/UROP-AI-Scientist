Best idea:
Develop a domain-adaptive pretraining stage for graph-generative models where the model is pretrained on a large, heterogeneous dataset and fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets. This method would leverage the vast data diversity at the pretraining stage to capture a broad range of graph characteristics before honing in on domain-specific nuances.
