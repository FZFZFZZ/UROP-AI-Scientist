  "target_idea": "Propose a large-scale training paradigm for graph generative models using a corpus of over 5000 graphs from 13 domains, leading to the development of large graph generative models (LGGMs) with superior zero-shot generative capabilities and the ability to be fine-tuned for specific domains. Additionally, introduce a Text-to-Graph generation capability inspired by Stable Diffusion, allowing for detailed control over the generated graphs using textual descriptions.",
  "context": "Large Generative Models (LGMs) like GPT and Stable Diffusion are trained on vast and diverse datasets across multiple domains, enhancing the creativity and diversity of their outputs. In contrast, existing graph-generative models have been limited to training on single datasets, preventing them from achieving similar breakthroughs.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning framework for graph-generative models that learns to adapt to various domains by dynamically adjusting model parameters and training strategies based on input graph characteristics. The framework would use transfer learning and multi-task learning techniques, pooling knowledge from diverse domains (e.g., social networks, molecular structures, transportation networks) to improve generalization and performance across all types of graphs. Additionally, the model would employ a novel regularization technique that minimizes overfitting to any single domain, enabling it to generate more diverse and accurate graphical outputs.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a domain-adaptive pretraining stage for graph-generative models where the model is pretrained on a large, heterogeneous dataset and fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets. This method would leverage the vast data diversity at the pretraining stage to capture a broad range of graph characteristics before honing in on domain-specific nuances.",
