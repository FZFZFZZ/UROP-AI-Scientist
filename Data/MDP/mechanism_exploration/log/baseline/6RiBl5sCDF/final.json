  "target_idea": "Introduce GeoX, a multi-modal large model designed for geometric understanding and reasoning, featuring unimodal pre-training for a diagram encoder and symbol decoder, geometry-language alignment to bridge modality gaps, and a Generator-And-Sampler Transformer (GS-Former) to enhance query generation and representation filtering. GeoX also incorporates visual instruction tuning to process geometric images and questions, generating verifiable solutions.",
  "context": "Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face challenges in automatic Geometry Problem Solving (GPS) due to the need for understanding diagrams, interpreting symbols, and performing complex reasoning. These models are limited by their pre-training on natural images and texts and the absence of automated verification in problem-solving. Additionally, current geometric specialists are constrained by task-specific designs, reducing their effectiveness for broader geometric problems.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid geometric reasoning framework that integrates a meta-learning layer with a multi-modal architecture tailored for geometry problem-solving. This framework would adaptively retrain specific modules based on feedback from a symbolic reasoning engine that verifies geometric proofs and computations. By using meta-learning, the system could dynamically adjust its strategies for diagram interpretation and symbolic manipulation, improving its capability to generalize across diverse geometric problems and potentially even self-correct its reasoning paths.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a modular neural network architecture that allows for the swapping and optimization of different components such as diagram interpretation modules and symbolic reasoning engines, facilitating the fine-tuning of the model for specific types of geometric problems.",
