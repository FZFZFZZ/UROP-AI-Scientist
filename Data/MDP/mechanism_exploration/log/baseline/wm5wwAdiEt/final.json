  "target_idea": "Introduce the Implicit Channel Protocol (ICP) framework, which enables agents to communicate through implicit channels by using a subset of actions called scouting actions. These actions are mapped to encode and decode messages, and training algorithms are proposed for agents to learn messaging and actions using both randomly initialized and delayed information maps.",
  "context": "In collaborative multi-agent systems, effective communication is crucial, especially in scenarios where explicit messaging is not possible. Historically, implicit communication has been a common solution in such situations. Previous approaches to learning implicit communication have primarily relied on the theory of mind (ToM), where agents deduce the mental states and intentions of others by analyzing their actions. However, ToM-based methods struggle with accuracy in complex tasks.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that leverages environmental affordances as indirect communication channels. In this system, agents can manipulate elements of the environment (e.g., changing light levels, altering object positions) to signal intent or state changes to other agents without traditional messaging systems. This method builds upon existing concepts in embodied cognition, enabling agents to communicate more robustly and effectively in complex scenarios by utilizing the physical context itself as a form of communication.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a formalized language or set of protocols that guides how agents can manipulate and interpret changes in the environment, creating a standardized method for implicit communication that can be universally applied across different types of multi-agent systems.",
