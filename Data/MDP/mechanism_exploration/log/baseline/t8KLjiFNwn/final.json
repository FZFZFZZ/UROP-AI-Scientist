  "target_idea": "Propose a sparse learning framework that integrates architecture-aware compiler optimizations, introducing an end-to-end solution called C4^n kernel sparsity, which prunes n elements from every four contiguous weights. Develop a compiler-based acceleration solution to ensure execution efficiency for this sparsity on mobile devices, and propose C4^n-specific optimizations combined with a layout transformation elimination strategy to improve performance across operations.",
  "context": "Transformer models have been extensively explored for their ability to handle long-range dependencies and provide global contextual awareness, which has been crucial for the development of AI applications like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Alexa. State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as strong competitors in sequential modeling by incorporating a selective mechanism for dynamic parameter adjustment, enhancing performance. However, this mechanism increases computational complexity and bandwidth demands, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid architecture combining the adaptive parameter abilities of State Space Models (SSMs) with the efficient attention mechanisms of sparse transformers. This architecture would use a compact SSM to dynamically adjust the parameters of only the most computationally expensive layers of the transformer, reducing overall model size and computational demands. This method aims to maintain high performance on sequential tasks while being viable for deployment on resource-constrained devices like smartphones and wearables.",
  "final_idea": "Explore the use of sparsity-inducing regularization during the training of the SSM-Transformer models to naturally reduce the number of active parameters, thereby decreasing the model's computational complexity and improving deployment feasibility on mobile devices.",
