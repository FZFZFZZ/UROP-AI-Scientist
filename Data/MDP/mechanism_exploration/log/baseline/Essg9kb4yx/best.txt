Best idea:
Develop an incremental unlearning mechanism that utilizes differential privacy to obscure the specific data points being unlearned, thereby maintaining the model's performance while adhering to privacy regulations. This approach can handle continuous unlearning requests by applying noise to the gradients during the unlearning phase.
