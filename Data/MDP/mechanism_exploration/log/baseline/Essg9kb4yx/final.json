  "target_idea": "Propose the OOO framework, which includes an Orthogonal low-rank adapter (LoRA) for continual unlearning and an Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detector to assess input similarity with unlearned data. The framework uses a novel contrastive entropy loss and a glocal-aware scoring mechanism to manage unlearning without relying on retained data.",
  "context": "Large language models have shown impressive performance across various tasks, but they face significant security issues. Machine unlearning has been developed to enhance model safety by removing the influence of unwanted data. However, current methods struggle with continuous unlearning requests, leading to potential utility loss, and often overlook data access limitations due to privacy and copyright concerns.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a decentralized, blockchain-based protocol for language model unlearning, where each data item used in training a model is associated with a unique cryptographic token that can be traded or revoked by its owner. When a token is revoked, the protocol automatically triggers a secure, verifiable process of data unlearning within the model, ensuring compliance with privacy and copyright without compromising model integrity. This system could dynamically adjust the model's training based on the current composition of valid tokens, enabling continuous, transparent, and controlled model updating and data governance.",
  "final_idea": "Develop an incremental unlearning mechanism that utilizes differential privacy to obscure the specific data points being unlearned, thereby maintaining the model's performance while adhering to privacy regulations. This approach can handle continuous unlearning requests by applying noise to the gradients during the unlearning phase.",
