  "target_idea": "Propose Shape as Line Segments (SALS), an implicit geometry representation using attributed line segments to accurately and efficiently model arbitrary structures. SALS employs a differentiable Line Segment Field to capture spatial relationships, using attributes like intersection flag and ratio for edge-based dual contouring to extract surfaces. Implement SALS with a neural network and design a learning-based pipeline for surface reconstruction from 3D point clouds.",
  "context": "Distance field-based implicit representations, such as signed or unsigned distance fields, are commonly used in geometry modeling and analysis. These methods depend on the closest distance of points to a surface, which can lead to inaccuracies during surface extraction, particularly when interpolating along cube edges. Additionally, the gradients of these fields are not well-defined at certain points, resulting in distortions in the extracted surfaces.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive resolution technique for distance field-based implicit representations that dynamically adjusts the sampling density based on local geometric complexity. This method could employ machine learning algorithms to predict areas of high curvature or fine features, automatically increasing sampling density in these regions and reducing it in flatter areas. Such an approach would minimize inaccuracies during surface extraction and improve the definition of gradients, resulting in smoother, more accurate geometrical representations.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a variational autoencoder framework to generate and refine distance fields from a set of training examples. This approach could learn a latent representation of complex geometries, allowing for more precise control over the interpolation and surface extraction processes.",
