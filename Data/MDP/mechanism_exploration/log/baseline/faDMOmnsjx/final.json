  "target_idea": "Introduce the perturbed cosine router, which stabilizes the cosine router by adding noise to the ℓ²-norms, significantly improving the estimation rates of experts and model parameters to polynomial rates under strongly identifiable settings.",
  "context": "The cosine router in Mixture of Experts (MoE) has shown promising performance in image and language tasks, addressing issues like representation collapse, which can lead to parameter redundancy and limited representation potential. However, a detailed analysis of the cosine router's performance and limitations has been lacking, particularly concerning the slow estimation rates of experts and model parameters due to intrinsic interactions within the model.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid routing mechanism in the Mixture of Experts framework that combines cosine similarity for initial expert selection with reinforcement learning to adjust expert weights dynamically based on performance feedback. This method could accelerate the adaptation of the model by learning optimal expert combinations over time and addressing the slow estimation rates issue. Moreover, integrating a context-aware penalization scheme where less useful experts are gradually phased out through a decay factor could optimize computational resources and improve overall efficiency.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a regularization term specifically designed for the cosine router in MoE that penalizes the divergence in expert performance, aiming to stabilize learning and reduce the variance in parameter estimates across different tasks.",
