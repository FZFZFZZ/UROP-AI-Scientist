  "target_idea": "Propose a unifying axiomatic framework that connects graph and topological message-passing by interpreting simplicial and cellular complexes as relational structures, thereby extending graph-theoretic results and algorithms to higher-order structures to address oversquashing in topological message-passing networks.",
  "context": "Topological deep learning (TDL) is increasingly used for modeling complex interactions in relational data. Despite its potential, issues like oversquashing in topological message-passing are not well understood and lack comprehensive theoretical analysis.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid model integrating topological deep learning with attention mechanisms to address the oversquashing issue in topological message-passing. The model would use selective attention to prioritize and dynamically adjust the flow of information based on the relevance and structural role of nodes within complex networks. This approach not only targets the reduction of information loss but also enhances the interpretability of these networks by identifying critical pathways and nodes influencing overall network behavior.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a theoretical framework for quantifying and analyzing oversquashing in TDL, incorporating algebraic topology tools to better understand how information is compressed and distorted across different topological structures.",
