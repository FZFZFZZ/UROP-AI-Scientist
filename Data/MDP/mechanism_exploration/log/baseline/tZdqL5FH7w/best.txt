Best idea:
Implement a concept dependency graph in the erasure algorithm, which maps out the relationships between various concepts and uses graph theory to optimize the erasure process. This approach ensures that the removal of one concept does not inadvertently destabilize other valuable content, maintaining both the integrity and utility of the model.
