  "target_idea": "Develop a calibrated deep clustering framework featuring a dual head model with a calibration head and a clustering head. The calibration head adjusts overconfident predictions, aligning prediction confidence with the model's learning status, while the clustering head selects reliable high-confidence samples for pseudo-label self-training. Additionally, introduce a network initialization strategy to improve training speed and robustness.",
  "context": "Deep clustering has shown impressive results, but it suffers from an overconfidence problem where the predicted confidence for a sample's cluster membership is much higher than its actual prediction accuracy. This issue has not been adequately addressed in previous research.",
  "initial_idea": "Introduce a calibration mechanism into the deep clustering process that utilizes uncertainty quantification techniques such as Bayesian inference or dropout as a Bayesian approximation. This mechanism can dynamically adjust the confidence scores based on the posterior distribution of the cluster assignments, thereby aligning the model's confidence with its prediction accuracy. Further, incorporating an adaptive re-weighting scheme that penalizes overconfident incorrect predictions could enhance the calibration by continuously refining confidence assessments based on feedback from cluster validation metrics.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a multi-task learning approach where one task focuses on cluster assignment and another on confidence estimation. This dual-task architecture would allow the model to leverage shared representations while independently optimizing for accurate clustering and realistic confidence estimation, promoting better generalization and calibration.",
