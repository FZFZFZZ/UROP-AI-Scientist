Best idea:
Implement a contrastive learning scheme in LVLMs to better delineate between in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples during training. By explicitly teaching the model what 'not' to expect, it can develop a more nuanced understanding of edge cases, enhancing its ability to flag these during deployment.
