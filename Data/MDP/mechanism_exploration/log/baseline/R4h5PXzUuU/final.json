  "target_idea": "Introduce a self-guided prompting approach called Reflexive Guidance (ReGuide) to enhance the OoDD capabilities of LVLMs by using self-generated image-adaptive concept suggestions.",
  "context": "The emergence of foundation models trained on large-scale internet data has led to their widespread adoption across various application domains. However, the trustworthiness of these models, particularly their out-of-distribution detection (OoDD) capabilities, remains underexplored. This gap raises concerns about the safe deployment of large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, which are trained on extensive multi-modal data.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning framework for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that dynamically adjusts their confidence thresholds based on real-time feedback on output relevance and accuracy in various environments. This system would utilize auxiliary networks trained to assess input similarity to the training distribution, adjust the primary modelâ€™s response strategy, and explicitly signal when the input appears to be out-of-distribution. The feedback mechanism would refine the model's understanding over time, potentially via reinforcement learning, enhancing trust and reliability in practical applications.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a contrastive learning scheme in LVLMs to better delineate between in-distribution and out-of-distribution examples during training. By explicitly teaching the model what 'not' to expect, it can develop a more nuanced understanding of edge cases, enhancing its ability to flag these during deployment.",
