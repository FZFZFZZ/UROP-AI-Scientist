  "target_idea": "Introduce Centaurus, a network architecture composed of generalized state-space model blocks, allowing tensor contractions to optimize training efficiency. This design incorporates a mixture of classical convolutional block inspirations, such as group convolutions and bottleneck blocks, to enhance flexibility and efficiency without relying on traditional recurrence, convolution, or attention mechanisms.",
  "context": "Traditional neural network architectures for audio processing tasks often rely on homogeneous configurations and specific types of operations like nonlinear recurrence, explicit convolutions, or attention mechanisms. These approaches can limit flexibility and efficiency in network design, particularly when balancing network size, performance, and computational resources.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid modular neural network architecture for audio processing that dynamically adapiles its configuration based on the task's complexity and computational budget. The architecture would utilize interchangeable modules, each specializing in different operations such as convolution, recurrence, or attention. Based on real-time analysis of the audio input and desired output characteristics, an orchestrating algorithm optimizes the network structure, selectively integrating and activating the most relevant modules to maximize performance efficiency and adaptability.",
  "final_idea": "Investigate the integration of heterogeneous processing units within a single neural network architecture for audio tasks, allowing each unit to specialize in different types of audio processing operations such as temporal pattern recognition or frequency separation, potentially enhancing both efficiency and performance.",
