  "target_idea": "Introduce Activation Transport (AcT), a framework that uses optimal transport theory to steer model activations, offering fine-grained control over model behavior with minimal computational overhead and impact on model abilities.",
  "context": "The deployment of large generative models has led to concerns regarding their reliability, safety, and potential misuse. Recent efforts have focused on controlling model generation by steering model activations to manage the emergence of certain concepts or behaviors in the output.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a \"conceptual depth sensor\" system for large generative models which dynamically measures and visualizes the depth of thematic layers during text generation. This system would use a depth estimation algorithm tailored to the model's activation pathways, enabling real-time adjustments to the depth of certain topics or concepts, thereby enhancing the modelâ€™s ability to self-regulate undesirable content before it materializes in output. This approach would allow operators to set depth thresholds that maintain creativity while ensuring ethical boundaries are respected, effectively balancing freedom and control in generative outputs.",
  "final_idea": "Utilize a 'layer-specific intervention strategy' where different layers of the model's neural network are individually tuned to respond to ethical guidelines, allowing for nuanced control over the depth and nature of generated content. This strategy would enable precise adjustments to be made at various stages of the generation process.",
