Best idea:
Integrate a counterfactual reasoning module into the reinforcement learning framework to enhance the causal inference engine. This module would allow the RL agent to not only observe and learn from actual outcomes but also consider hypothetical scenarios, assessing the impact of different actions on rewards and enabling more precise updates to the causal graph based on these counterfactual insights.
