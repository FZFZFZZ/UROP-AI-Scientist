  "target_idea": "Propose a method called Causal Information Prioritization (CIP) that enhances sample efficiency by using factored MDPs to infer causal relationships between states, actions, and rewards. CIP prioritizes causal information through counterfactual data augmentation and integrates a causality-aware empowerment learning objective to improve reward-guided exploration in complex environments.",
  "context": "Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods often face challenges with sample inefficiency due to exploration strategies that fail to consider causal relationships among states, actions, and rewards. Recent causal approaches attempt to address this issue but lack a grounded modeling of reward-guided causal understanding, which is crucial for goal-oriented learning and efficiency.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a reinforcement learning framework that utilizes a hybrid model combining traditional RL algorithms with a graph-based causal inference engine. In this framework, the RL agent constructs and updates a causal graph based on observed transitions and rewards. The causal graph is then used to simulate potential future scenarios and refine exploration strategies, prioritizing actions that lead to causally effective paths for achieving goals, thereby enhancing the sample efficiency of the learning process.",
  "final_idea": "Integrate a counterfactual reasoning module into the reinforcement learning framework to enhance the causal inference engine. This module would allow the RL agent to not only observe and learn from actual outcomes but also consider hypothetical scenarios, assessing the impact of different actions on rewards and enabling more precise updates to the causal graph based on these counterfactual insights.",
