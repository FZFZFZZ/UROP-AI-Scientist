  "target_idea": "Propose the Starlight algorithm to identify a star model within the SGD solution set, which is linearly connected to other solutions via low-loss paths, considering permutations. This approach also offers improved uncertainty estimates for Bayesian Model Averaging and suggests star models as alternatives to model ensembles.",
  "context": "Recent conjectures suggest that neural network solution sets reachable via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are convex when considering permutation invariances, implying that a linear path can connect two independent solutions with low loss if the weights are appropriately permuted. However, testing this theory often requires very wide networks.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dimensionality reduction technique tailored for neural network weights that preserves permutation invariance properties. By projecting the high-dimensional weight space into a lower-dimensional manifold, we can more feasibly analyze the convex nature of solution sets in smaller, more manageable networks. This approach will allow for practical experimentation and verification of the conjecture using less computational resources and can potentially uncover new geometric insights about the landscape of neural network solutions reached via SGD.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a theoretical framework to rigorously define and analyze the geometry of permutation-invariant solution spaces in neural networks, which could lead to more precise algorithms for finding linear paths between solutions.",
