  "target_idea": "Introduce patch-level training for LLMs, where multiple tokens are aggregated into a 'patch' to serve as the fundamental text unit for training. This approach involves training the model on shorter sequences of patches to predict the next patch, followed by token-level training to align with inference mode, thereby significantly reducing training costs.",
  "context": "The development of next-generation Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by the high training costs associated with these models. This has become a significant bottleneck, as reducing these costs without compromising performance is a major challenge.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid training protocol that combines unsupervised pre-training with supervised learning in a dynamic ratio, optimizing resource allocation by adapting the training methodology in real-time based on feedback about computational load and model performance. This process would utilize lightweight proxy models to predict the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of different training schema adjustments, enabling the main model to focus resources on the most beneficial stages of its training. Additionally, incorporate federated learning where multiple decentralized systems can train locally on their data and periodically share their improvements, drastically reducing the redundancy and overall computational demands.",
  "final_idea": "Utilize simulation-based training where initial training phases are conducted in simulated environments that require less computational power, reserving high-fidelity, computationally intensive environments for final training stages.",
