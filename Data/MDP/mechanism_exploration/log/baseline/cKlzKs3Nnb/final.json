  "target_idea": "Introduce DEI (Diversity Empowered Intelligence), a framework that acts as a meta-module to manage and leverage the unique expertise of existing software engineering agent frameworks, enhancing their collective problem-solving capabilities.",
  "context": "Large language model agents have demonstrated significant potential in addressing real-world software engineering problems. The most advanced open-source software engineering agents can resolve a notable percentage of real GitHub issues, but they exhibit varying strengths, excelling in some tasks while underperforming in others.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning framework for language model agents where they dynamically adapt and optimize their strategies based on the type of software engineering problem presented. This system would use transfer learning to refine its approach by analyzing successful resolution patterns in different sub-domains of software engineering issues (e.g., debugging, optimization, feature request implementations). By learning from each interaction and adjusting its strategy accordingly, the language model can become more efficient over time, significantly enhancing its problem-solving capabilities in a broader array of tasks.",
  "final_idea": "Propose the creation of a unified interface that aggregates the capabilities of various language model agents, allowing them to share resources and insights seamlessly, thereby increasing the collective problem-solving capacity.",
