Best idea:
Develop a decay mechanism based on reinforcement learning signals, where less relevant memories are phased out more rapidly, and crucial memories are strengthened. This dynamic memory management could help in maintaining a lean and efficient memory system, reducing computational overhead and improving response times in critical scenarios.
