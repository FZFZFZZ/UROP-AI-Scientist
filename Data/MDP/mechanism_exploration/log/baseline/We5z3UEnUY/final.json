  "target_idea": "Introduce the Stable Hadamard Memory, a novel memory model for reinforcement learning agents that dynamically adjusts memory by erasing unnecessary experiences and reinforcing crucial ones. This model uses the Hadamard product to calibrate and update memory, enhancing memory capacity while addressing numerical and learning challenges.",
  "context": "In partially observable environments, effective decision-making requires robust memory management. Current deep-learning memory models, despite their success in supervised learning, face challenges in reinforcement learning settings that are partially observable and long-term. These models struggle to efficiently capture relevant past information, adapt to changing observations, and maintain stable updates over extended episodes.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid memory architecture that combines differentiable neural dictionaries with episodic memory systems. The differentiable neural dictionary component allows immediate storage and retrieval of key observations, utilizing attention mechanisms to prioritize recent and relevant information. Meanwhile, the episodic memory component captures longer narrative structures and sequences in the environment, using a temporal coherence algorithm to update and reconsolidate memories based on their predictive relevance and decay profiles over time, thereby optimizing memory usage for crucial decision-making moments in long-term partially observable scenarios.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a decay mechanism based on reinforcement learning signals, where less relevant memories are phased out more rapidly, and crucial memories are strengthened. This dynamic memory management could help in maintaining a lean and efficient memory system, reducing computational overhead and improving response times in critical scenarios.",
