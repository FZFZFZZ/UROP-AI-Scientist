Best idea:
Create a modular uncertainty quantification framework that allows for the incorporation of domain-specific decision-making modules. These modules would utilize a combination of Bayesian and frequentist methodologies to adaptively refine uncertainty estimates as more decision outcomes become available, enhancing the precision of decision support in critical areas.
