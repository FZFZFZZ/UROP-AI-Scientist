  "target_idea": "Propose a nondeterministic neural network regression architecture optimized for loss functions based on a sample-based approximation of the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), allowing a distribution-free approach by learning to sample from the target's aleatoric distribution instead of predicting explicit densities.",
  "context": "Quantifying uncertainty is crucial in predictive modeling, particularly for high-stakes decision-making. In classification tasks, uncertainty is naturally included as class probabilities, but regression tasks typically focus on predicting the expected value of the target variable. Probabilistic extensions often rely on parametric distributions around this expected value, which can limit the model's ability to capture complex distributions such as skewed or multi-modal ones.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a regression model that integrates deep generative networks, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), with Gaussian Processes (GPs) to predict full conditional distributions rather than just point estimates. The VAE would learn a latent representation of the input features, capturing complex patterns and dependencies, while the GP, conditioned on this latent space, provides a non-parametric way to estimate uncertainty including confidence intervals. This hybrid approach allows for capturing multimodality and asymmetric uncertainties in predictions, optimizing predictive performance for regression tasks in uncertain environments.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a regression framework using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) alongside Gaussian Processes, where GANs are employed to generate synthetic data points that represent possible outcomes, and GPs are used to model the uncertainty around these outcomes. This dual approach allows for a dynamic adjustment of uncertainty estimates as more data becomes available, enhancing prediction accuracy.",
