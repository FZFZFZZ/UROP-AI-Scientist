Best idea:
Develop a regression framework using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) alongside Gaussian Processes, where GANs are employed to generate synthetic data points that represent possible outcomes, and GPs are used to model the uncertainty around these outcomes. This dual approach allows for a dynamic adjustment of uncertainty estimates as more data becomes available, enhancing prediction accuracy.
