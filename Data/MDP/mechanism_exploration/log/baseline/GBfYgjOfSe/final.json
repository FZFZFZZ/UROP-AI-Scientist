  "target_idea": "Introduce Ferret-UI 2, a multimodal large language model designed for universal UI understanding, featuring support for multiple platform types, high-resolution perception through adaptive scaling, and advanced task training data generation using GPT-4o with set-of-mark visual prompting.",
  "context": "Developing a generalist model for user interface understanding is difficult due to challenges such as platform diversity, resolution differences, and limited data availability. These foundational issues complicate the creation of a universal model that can effectively operate across various devices and platforms.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a federated learning-based approach to construct a generalist model for user interface understanding where users' devices contribute to model training without sharing raw data, thus addressing data privacy concerns and enabling the model to learn from a vast, diverse dataset. To manage resolution and platform variation, the model can dynamically adapt its focus and learning parameters based on real-time feedback on its performance across different devices, facilitated by a meta-learning layer that optimizes for generalizability and adaptability. This approach combines the power of distributed learning, the privacy preservation of federated systems, and the flexibility of meta-learning to create a robust, universal user interface understanding model.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a hierarchical learning framework that initially trains on low-resolution, platform-agnostic features and progressively adapts to high-resolution, platform-specific details, enhancing cross-platform generalizability and performance.",
