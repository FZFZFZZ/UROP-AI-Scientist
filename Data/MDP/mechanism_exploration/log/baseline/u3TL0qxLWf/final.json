  "target_idea": "Introduce SeedLM, a post-training compression method that encodes model weights using seeds of a pseudo-random generator. This method employs a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) to generate random matrices during inference, which are combined with compressed coefficients to reconstruct weight blocks, reducing memory access and utilizing idle compute cycles without relying on calibration data.",
  "context": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing but are hindered by high runtime costs, making widespread deployment challenging. These models require substantial memory access and computational resources, which limits their efficiency and scalability.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid compression-decompression framework for LLMs that dynamically adjusts model granularity based on task complexity and real-time computational load. The model would employ a variable-rate compression algorithm to significantly reduce the size of the neural network during lower complexity tasks, and decompress to full capacity for more complex queries. This approach would balance computational efficiency with performance, adapting in real-time to both system capabilities and task demands, hence reducing overall runtime costs.",
  "final_idea": "Explore the use of advanced data compression techniques such as deep generative models to encode and decode neural network parameters. This strategy would reduce the storage and bandwidth requirements for LLMs, allowing for quicker adjustments to model size and complexity based on operational demands.",
