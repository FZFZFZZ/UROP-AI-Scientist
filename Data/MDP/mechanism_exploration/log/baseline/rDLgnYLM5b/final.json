  "target_idea": "Introduce ISG, a comprehensive evaluation framework for interleaved text-and-image generation that uses a scene graph structure to assess consistency, coherence, and accuracy across four levels of granularity. Additionally, present ISG-Bench, a benchmark dataset with complex language-vision dependencies, and develop ISG-Agent, a baseline agent using a 'plan-execute-refine' pipeline to improve performance.",
  "context": "Many real-world user queries, such as those asking for recipes, could benefit from systems that generate responses with both textual instructions and accompanying images, similar to a cookbook. However, models designed to generate interleaved text and images face challenges in maintaining consistency within and across these modalities.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a multimodal generative adversarial network (GAN) model that leverages dual learning mechanisms—one for text and the other for images—to ensure consistency and relevance between the written content and visual content of recipes. The model will use a feedback loop where the text generator uses outputs from the image generator as context and vice versa, fine-tuning both generators through iterative refinement to better align the text with the corresponding visuals. This alignment can be further enhanced by training the model on a dataset curated with expert annotations on the quality and relevance of the text-image pairs.",
  "final_idea": "Establish a benchmarking platform for multimodal culinary content generation, where models can be systematically evaluated against a set of standardized metrics for text-image consistency, relevance, and user satisfaction. This platform could foster competition and innovation in the development of more effective generative models.",
