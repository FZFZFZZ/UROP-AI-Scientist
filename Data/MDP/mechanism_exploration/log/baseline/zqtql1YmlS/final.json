  "target_idea": "Propose the identification of Reduced Datasets for Offline RL (ReDOR) by framing it as a gradient approximation optimization problem, transforming the actor-critic framework into a submodular objective, and constructing subsets using a modified orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method.",
  "context": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) represents a significant shift in RL research, focusing on improving algorithm performance and training efficiency by determining the optimal subset of offline datasets. Understanding the necessary volume of offline data is crucial for tackling similar challenges.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning system tailored for offline RL that autonomously determines the optimal data volume and composition required for training different tasks. The system uses transfer learning techniques to generalize insights from previous offline RL tasks to predict the minimal and most effective dataset characteristics (such as diversity, density, and relevance of the data points) needed for new, unseen tasks. This approach would significantly reduce the trial-and-error process in offline RL dataset preparation, improving efficiency and scalability of RL applications.",
  "final_idea": "Employ adaptive sampling techniques in offline RL to enhance data efficiency by selectively sampling from the offline dataset based on uncertainty estimates. This method could reduce the required data volume by focusing on the most informative samples, potentially accelerating the convergence of the learning process.",
