  "target_idea": "Introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that autonomously generates and refines large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs through iterative collaboration between an instruction generator and a navigator, eliminating the need for human annotation. This process continuously improves the dataset quality, enhancing the training of language-guided navigation models.",
  "context": "Creating high-quality data for training language-instructed agents in embodied AI is a persistent challenge. Traditional methods often require extensive human annotation, which is time-consuming and limits scalability. The need for robust and scalable data generation methods is critical for advancing language-guided navigation learning.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an autonomous simulation framework that dynamically generates language-instructed tasks for embodied agents by synthesizing real-world scenarios using a combination of procedural content generation and crowd-sourced narrative input. This framework could employ machine learning algorithms trained to generate diverse, contextually-rich spatial and linguistic setups based on real-world data inputs, such as maps and street view imagery, combined with human-like task descriptions sourced interactively from online contributors. This approach would not only create a scalable method to produce varied and complex datasets but also integrate a layer of human nuance and unpredictability into the training data.",
  "final_idea": "Integrate a reinforcement learning model into the simulation framework that allows embodied agents to interact with and modify their environments, thereby generating new language-instruction scenarios based on their actions. This self-evolving system could learn to create increasingly complex tasks that mirror unforeseen real-world challenges, enhancing the agents' ability to generalize from training to real-world applications.",
