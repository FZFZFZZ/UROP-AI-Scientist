Best idea:
Integrate a reinforcement learning model into the simulation framework that allows embodied agents to interact with and modify their environments, thereby generating new language-instruction scenarios based on their actions. This self-evolving system could learn to create increasingly complex tasks that mirror unforeseen real-world challenges, enhancing the agents' ability to generalize from training to real-world applications.
