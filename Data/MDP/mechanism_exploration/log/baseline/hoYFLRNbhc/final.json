  "target_idea": "Introduce DelTA, a Document-levEL Translation Agent, which utilizes a multi-level memory structure to store and update information across different granularities, enhancing translation consistency and accuracy. DelTA employs a sentence-by-sentence translation strategy and features components like Proper Noun Records, Bilingual Summary, Long-Term Memory, and Short-Term Memory, managed by auxiliary LLM-based components.",
  "context": "Large language models have shown improvements in machine translation quality, but challenges remain in maintaining translation consistency and accuracy for entire documents. Current research struggles with these issues, particularly in processing and translating documents effectively.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a document-level translation framework that incorporates a memory-augmented neural network model. This model learns to maintain context and consistency by using an external memory structure that stores and retrieves context-relevant information across different parts of the document. By dynamically updating this memory during the translation process, the model can reference previous translations within the same document to ensure stylistic and terminological consistency.",
