Best idea:
Develop a document-level translation framework that incorporates a memory-augmented neural network model. This model learns to maintain context and consistency by using an external memory structure that stores and retrieves context-relevant information across different parts of the document. By dynamically updating this memory during the translation process, the model can reference previous translations within the same document to ensure stylistic and terminological consistency.
