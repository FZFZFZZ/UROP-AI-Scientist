  "target_idea": "Introduce VICtoR, a hierarchical VIC reward model that provides effective reward signals for long-horizon manipulation tasks by using a novel stage detector and motion progress evaluator, trained solely on primitive motion demonstrations.",
  "context": "The visual-instruction correlation (VIC) problem involves learning reward models for long-horizon manipulation tasks from action-free videos and language instructions. Existing methods struggle with challenges such as lack of sub-stage awareness, difficulty in modeling task complexities, and inadequate object state estimation, which hinder their ability to learn effective rewards for these tasks.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hierarchical deep learning model that incorporates a multimodal attention mechanism to dynamically focus on different aspects of the visual and linguistic inputs at various stages of a long-horizon task. This model would use reinforcement learning to fine-tune the attention parameters based on intermediate rewards that are implicitly segmented by changes in linguistic cues and visual scenery, thus promoting sub-stage awareness and adaptive learning of complex task structures. Additionally, integrate an object-centric representation layer that continually updates the estimated states of key objects involved, using recurrent neural networks to maintain temporal consistency across frames.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that breaks down long-horizon tasks into manageable sub-tasks, each associated with its own reward model trained on segmented action-free videos and corresponding language instructions. This method addresses sub-stage awareness and improves the granularity of task understanding.",
