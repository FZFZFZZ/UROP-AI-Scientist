  "target_idea": "Introduce a benchmark that evaluates numerical understanding and processing ability (NUPA) in LLMs across four numerical representations and 17 tasks, resulting in 41 combinations. This benchmark is derived from educational curricula and aims to assess everyday numerical scenarios. Additionally, the study explores the effectiveness of various techniques, including finetuning and chain-of-thought methods, to enhance NUPA in LLMs.",
  "context": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in complex reasoning tasks but often make errors in basic numerical understanding and processing, which is crucial for solving arithmetic and mathematical problems. Previous research has largely overlooked this aspect or focused on limited tasks, leaving a gap in comprehensive evaluation of numerical abilities in LLMs.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive numerical reasoning benchmark tailored for large language models, incorporating tasks that range from basic arithmetic to complex mathematical reasoning, such as solving real-world problems that integrate uncertainty, stochastic processes, and algebra. This benchmark will dynamically adjust the difficulty and complexity of the problems based on the model's performance, aiming to identify the threshold at which the model's numerical understanding begins to fail. Additionally, the benchmark should include a module that specifically tests the model's ability to switch between different numerical bases and systems, which is often a challenge for current models.",
  "final_idea": "Create a specialized dataset featuring a wide array of numerical formats and contexts, from simple arithmetic to complex real-world data analysis scenarios, to rigorously test the LLMs' versatility in numerical understanding.",
