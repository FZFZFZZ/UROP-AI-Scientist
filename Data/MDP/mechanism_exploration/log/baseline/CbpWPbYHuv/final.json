  "target_idea": "Propose a new category of polynomial composition activations (PolyCom) to optimize transformer dynamics, providing a mathematical analysis of its enhanced expressivity and efficacy. PolyCom networks achieve the optimal approximation rate, requiring minimal parameters to approximate general smooth functions in Sobolev spaces.",
  "context": "Transformers are widely used across various domains due to their strong fitting capabilities, largely attributed to their inherent nonlinearity. Researchers have explored alternative modules to the ReLU function, such as GeLU and SwishGLU, to enhance nonlinearity and improve representational capacity.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a transformer model architecture that integrates adaptive activation functions, which dynamically adjust their characteristics (e.g., steepness, inflection point) based on the input data and the training phase progression. This adaptability could be achieved through the incorporation of meta-learning techniques that guide the evolution of the activation functions' parameters, potentially leading to optimized nonlinearity tailored for specific tasks like language understanding or image recognition. Additionally, this approach would include a mechanism for regularization specifically designed to stabilize the learning of these adaptive functions, preventing overfitting and enhancing generalization.",
  "final_idea": "Design a transformer where the activation functions are parameterized using polynomial approximations of solutions to differential equations, which can be optimized directly during training to better fit complex data patterns, thus enhancing model capacity.",
