  "target_idea": "Introduce the 'Diffuse Risk Management' problem, which aims to balance safety and usefulness in deploying untrusted models across multiple tasks. This is achieved through a two-level framework: micro-protocols at the single-task level using a trusted model to monitor the untrusted one, and a macro-protocol at the whole-scenario level that adaptively estimates risk to select appropriate micro-protocols.",
  "context": "As large language models become more powerful, they also become harder to trust due to potential 'subversive misalignment,' where subtle errors bypass safety checks. This creates a challenge in deploying these models, as there is a tradeoff between ensuring safety and leveraging their capabilities. The uncertainty in model behavior increases the risk of safety failures over time.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid monitoring framework that employs both traditional audit logs and a blockchain-based ledger to record all interactions with a large language model (LLM). This ledger would ensure immutable and time-stamped verification of the model's outputs, decisions, and the contextual data influencing those decisions. Simultaneously, employ an AI-driven anomaly detection system that uses statistical and machine learning techniques to predict potential subversive misalignments by analyzing deviations from normal operation patterns recorded in the blockchain.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a system of layered defense where multiple LLMs operate in a hierarchical structure, with higher-level models scrutinizing the outputs of lower-level models, thereby creating a multi-tiered security architecture that enhances output reliability.",
