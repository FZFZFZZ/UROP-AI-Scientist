  "target_idea": "Investigate and develop various methods to mitigate memorization in language models, including three regularizer-based, three fine-tuning-based, and eleven machine unlearning-based methods, with five new unlearning methods introduced. Additionally, introduce TinyMem, a suite of small, computationally-efficient language models designed for the rapid development and evaluation of these memorization-mitigation methods.",
  "context": "Language models have the capability to memorize information from their training data, which can lead to the unintended regurgitation of verbatim data during inference. This poses a problem, especially when the data involved is private or sensitive.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a \"data exposure risk assessment tool\" for language models that predicts and quantifies the likelihood of exposing sensitive or private data based on the input query context and the generated responses. The tool uses a combination of anomaly detection techniques to identify patterns that correlate with sensitive information disclosure and employs differential privacy measures to adjust the response generation process dynamically. This ensures that responses are generated in a way that minimizes the risk of disclosing sensitive information while maintaining the utility of the model.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a model training protocol that includes a 'forgetting' mechanism, where the model periodically forgets certain data points, particularly those not frequently used but sensitive, to prevent long-term data retention and potential exposure.",
