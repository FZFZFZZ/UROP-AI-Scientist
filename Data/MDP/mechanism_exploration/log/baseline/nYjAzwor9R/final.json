  "target_idea": "Propose a new tree-Wasserstein distance (TWD) specifically designed for data with a latent feature hierarchy by embedding features into a multi-scale hyperbolic space using diffusion geometry. Introduce a novel tree decoding method that draws analogies between hyperbolic embeddings and trees to learn the latent feature hierarchy efficiently.",
  "context": "Determining meaningful distances between high-dimensional data samples is a critical scientific challenge. Traditional methods often focus on embedding samples in hyperbolic space to compute distances efficiently, but these approaches may not effectively capture latent feature hierarchies within the data.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid embedding framework that combines hyperbolic and spherical embeddings to effectively capture hierarchical and angular relationships in high-dimensional data. In this approach, use hyperbolic space to encode the hierarchical levels of the data features, while spherical embeddings can be employed to represent angular relationships and intrinsic dimensional clusters that are not well-captured by hyperbolic metrics. This dual-structure embedding could offer a more nuanced distance metric, potentially improving tasks like clustering, visualization, and anomaly detection in complex datasets.",
  "final_idea": "Integrate a multi-scale approach to dimensionality reduction by constructing embeddings that operate at different resolutions, capturing both macro and micro hierarchical structures within high-dimensional data. This method could enhance the adaptability of machine learning models to various scales of data complexity.",
