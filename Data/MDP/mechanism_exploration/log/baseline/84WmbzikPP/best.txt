Best idea:
Develop an AI-driven hybrid modeling framework that integrates quantum chemistry simulations with deep learning to predict molecular structures. This framework would utilize a novel neural architecture that learns to correct discrepancies between predicted and observed moments of inertia by adjusting simulated molecular conformations in real-time. This approach leverages the high precision of rotational spectroscopy data to continually refine and optimize the 3D structures, improving the accuracy and reliability of molecular structure predictions in complex chemical environments.
