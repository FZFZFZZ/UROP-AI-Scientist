  "target_idea": "Introduce NovelQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on complex, extended narratives derived from English novels, featuring a comprehensive manual annotation process and diverse question types to assess nuanced comprehension.",
  "context": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved natural language processing capabilities, particularly in understanding long contexts. However, evaluating these models' abilities to comprehend extended narratives remains challenging due to the inadequacies of existing benchmarks.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic narrative comprehension benchmark that utilizes interactive storytelling to evaluate LLMs. In this setup, the model would engage in a multi-turn dialogue with a human or another AI, where it must coherently advance a story based on previous narrative elements discussed, generating and responding to plot twists and character developments. The modelâ€™s performance would be assessed based on its ability to maintain narrative consistency, creativity in plot development, and emotional coherence in character interactions.",
  "final_idea": "Construct a dataset based on classical literature with complex narrative structures, such as nested stories or stories within stories, to assess LLM's ability to understand and generate contextually appropriate responses in a sophisticated literary framework.",
