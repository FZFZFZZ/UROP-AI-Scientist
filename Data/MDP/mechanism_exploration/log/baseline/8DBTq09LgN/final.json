  "target_idea": "Introduce a novel LLM-guided search framework (LLM-GS) that utilizes the programming expertise and reasoning capabilities of large language models to enhance search efficiency. This includes a Pythonic-DSL strategy for generating domain-specific language programs and a Scheduled Hill Climbing algorithm to optimize the search process.",
  "context": "Programmatic reinforcement learning (PRL) aims to represent policies through programs to achieve interpretability and generalization. However, current PRL methods suffer from sample inefficiency, requiring extensive program-environment interactions.",
  "initial_idea": "Introduce a hybrid architecture that combines programmatic reinforcement learning with a predictive world model. The world model, trained separately on a diverse dataset of environment interactions, can simulate potential future states given current observations and actions. By enabling the PRL system to \"imagine\" and evaluate potential future scenarios generated by the world model before executing actions in the real environment, this approach could drastically reduce the sample inefficiency of PRL methods by decreasing dependency on actual environment interactions.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a hybrid model that combines deep learning with symbolic program generation in PRL, where neural networks propose candidate programs and symbolic methods refine them according to logical constraints and environmental feedback.",
