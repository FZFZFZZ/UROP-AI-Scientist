  "target_idea": "Identify conditions for theoretical failure in unlabeled OOD detection from an information-theoretic perspective, introducing the concept of 'label blindness' where zero mutual information exists between the learning objective and in-distribution labels. Define a new OOD task, Adjacent OOD detection, to test for label blindness and address a safety gap in existing benchmarks.",
  "context": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for safety-critical autonomous systems to reject invalid inputs that could lead to errors. Traditional OOD detection methods rely on labeled data, which is costly, prompting exploration into self-supervised, unlabeled, and zero-shot OOD detection. However, challenges remain in ensuring the reliability of these methods, particularly in real-world data scenarios.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive OOD detection system that utilizes a hybrid approach combining self-supervised learning with real-time anomaly scoring based on adversarial training. The system employs generative adversarial networks (GANs) where the generator attempts to simulate near-distribution scenarios while the discriminator progressively learns to identify subtle deviations from normal operations. This dynamic interplay allows the system to continually refine its understanding of \"normal\" and \"abnormal,\" effectively adapting to new, unseen out-of-distribution data without the need for labeled data, thereby enhancing reliability in changing operational environments.",
  "final_idea": "Incorporate an ensemble learning strategy into the adaptive OOD detection system to enhance decision-making reliability. By aggregating predictions from multiple self-supervised models, the system can reduce the variance of anomaly scores, leading to more stable and reliable OOD detection in fluctuating operational environments.",
