  "target_idea": "Revisit feature normalization on embedding vectors as a debiasing method for unseen domain data, analyzing its effectiveness in reducing bias related to low-level image properties and body angle. Propose simple training strategies to mitigate camera bias in unsupervised learning, demonstrating significant performance improvements with minor modifications to existing algorithms.",
  "context": "Person re-identification (ReID) models often suffer from camera bias, which becomes more pronounced under data distribution shifts. Previous methods to address this bias have been limited to the training domains of the models. Additionally, unsupervised learning of ReID models shows a strong bias towards camera labels, even for seen domain data, indicating a need for improvement.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning framework for person re-identification (ReID) that adapts to new cameras or domains in real-time. This system would use few-shot learning techniques, training on a small number of images from new cameras to quickly adjust the model parameters without retraining the entire network. Additionally, integrate an adversarial training component that actively seeks to minimize the difference in feature representations between different cameras, promoting a camera-agnostic feature space.",
  "final_idea": "Incorporate a camera-aware normalization layer into ReID models that adjusts the feature distribution based on the identified camera, aiming to neutralize the effect of camera-specific biases dynamically.",
