Best idea:
Develop a dynamic benchmarking framework for LLMs focusing on code generation in interactive settings, which simulates real-world coding sessions by introducing variable, context-based feedback loops. This framework would use a virtual "pair programming" environment where the model interacts with simulated users (also driven by AI) that provide diverse types of feedback, including suggestions, bug reports, and requirement changes. The performance of LLMs could then be evaluated based on the adaptability and accuracy in refining and modifying code in response to this multi-dimensional feedback over extended interactive sessions.
