  "target_idea": "Introduce novel benchmarks that model feedback quality for code generation LLMs, including CONVCODEWORLD, an environment simulating interactive scenarios with various feedback types, and CONVCODEBENCH, a static version using pre-generated feedback logs to maintain evaluation efficiency.",
  "context": "Large language models (LLMs) are crucial for code generation, especially in interactive settings. However, current benchmarks do not adequately reflect the diverse feedback encountered in multi-turn interactions, hindering the evaluation of LLMs in these scenarios.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic benchmarking framework for LLMs focusing on code generation in interactive settings, which simulates real-world coding sessions by introducing variable, context-based feedback loops. This framework would use a virtual \"pair programming\" environment where the model interacts with simulated users (also driven by AI) that provide diverse types of feedback, including suggestions, bug reports, and requirement changes. The performance of LLMs could then be evaluated based on the adaptability and accuracy in refining and modifying code in response to this multi-dimensional feedback over extended interactive sessions.",
