  "target_idea": "Propose a direct semantic modeling approach that predicts the semantic representation of a dynamical system directly from data, bypassing the need for complex post-hoc analysis. This method allows for the incorporation of intuitive inductive biases and direct editing of the model's behavior, simplifying the modeling pipeline and enhancing model transparency and flexibility.",
  "context": "Data-driven modeling of dynamical systems is essential in machine learning, particularly for applications requiring a deep understanding of model behavior, such as pharmacokinetic models in drug development. Traditional methods involve discovering closed-form ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and analyzing them, but this process is often time-consuming, requires significant expertise, and can be challenging if the equations are complex or need modification.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid AI framework that combines neural networks with symbolic regression to automatically generate and refine ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for dynamical systems modeling. This framework would use deep learning to predict the system's behavior and identify key parameters, which are then used by symbolic regression algorithms to form interpretable, closed-form ODEs. The system would iteratively adjust the neural network and the equation forms based on performance metrics, enabling more accurate and robust modeling of complex dynamical systems in fields like pharmacokinetics without requiring extensive human intervention.",
  "final_idea": "Explore the use of continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs) to directly model the dynamical systems, using the outputs from these networks as a basis for symbolic regression to derive ODEs, potentially simplifying the modeling process and increasing the adaptability of the system to changes in dynamics.",
