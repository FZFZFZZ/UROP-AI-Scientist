Explore the use of continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs) to directly model the dynamical systems, using the outputs from these networks as a basis for symbolic regression to derive ODEs, potentially simplifying the modeling process and increasing the adaptability of the system to changes in dynamics.
