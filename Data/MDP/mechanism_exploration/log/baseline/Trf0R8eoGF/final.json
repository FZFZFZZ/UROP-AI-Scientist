  "target_idea": "Introduce AvatarGO, a framework for generating animatable 4D HOI scenes from textual inputs. It addresses spatial challenges with LLM-guided contact retargeting to identify contact body parts from text prompts, and interaction dynamics with correspondence-aware motion optimization using the linear blend skinning function from SMPL-X to construct motion fields for human and object models.",
  "context": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have improved the generation and animation of 4D full-body human-object interactions. However, existing methods are limited by their reliance on SMPL-based motion generation, which suffers from a lack of realistic large-scale interaction data, hindering the creation of everyday HOI scenes. Additionally, diffusion models struggle with understanding the spatial and interaction dynamics between humans and objects.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid diffusion model that integrates physics simulation data into the learning process, permitting more dynamic and realistic human-object interaction predictions. By complementing SMPL with physical simulation inputs, such as force, momentum, and material properties, the model can learn the nuances of physical interactions in a more grounded and realistic manner. Additionally, introduce a feedback module that refines the generated interactions based on real-time physical plausibility assessments, allowing the model to adjust and improve interaction dynamics iteratively.",
  "final_idea": "Explore the integration of semantic understanding in diffusion models by embedding language models that can interpret and generate human-object interactions based on textual descriptions, thereby bridging the gap between visual and linguistic modalities.",
