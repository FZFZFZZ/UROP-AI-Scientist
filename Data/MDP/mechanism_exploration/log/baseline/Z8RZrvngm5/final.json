  "target_idea": "Propose the zero-cost proxy Network Expressivity by Activation Rank (NEAR), which uses the effective rank of the pre- and post-activation matrix to identify optimal networks without training. This method also provides a straightforward approach to estimate optimal layer sizes in multi-layer perceptrons and select hyperparameters such as activation functions and weight initialization schemes.",
  "context": "Artificial neural networks are recognized as state-of-the-art models in various applications like natural language processing and image recognition. However, designing an effective neural network is challenging and demands significant computational resources. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to automate the selection of optimal network architectures, but many NAS methods still require training some networks, which is resource-intensive.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid NAS approach that combines analytical modeling and reinforcement learning to predict performance metrics of neural architectures without full training. Use analytical models to estimate the lower-bound performance based on simplified assumptions and architectural features, then employ a reinforcement learning agent to refine these estimates by exploring and learning from a subset of partially trained architectures. This method aims to significantly reduce the computational resources needed by focusing the training efforts only where the reinforcement learning model identifies potential based on initial analytical predictions.",
  "final_idea": "Utilize a simulation-based approach in NAS where virtualized and approximated performance metrics are used to evaluate architectures, reducing the reliance on actual training and thereby saving computational resources.",
