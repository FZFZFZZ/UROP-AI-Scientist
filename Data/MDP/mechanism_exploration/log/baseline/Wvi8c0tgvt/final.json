  "target_idea": "Propose a 3D-aware blur synthesizer that generates diverse and realistic blur images for data augmentation by estimating 3D camera positions during motion blur intervals, generating scene images, and aggregating them. This approach allows for 3D transformation without explicit depth measurements by estimating a 3D residual component via a neural network, enabling controllable blur data augmentation.",
  "context": "Existing blur datasets lack sufficient variety in scenes and blur patterns, making them inadequate for training. Expanding data diversity is challenging due to the complexity and effort required by dual-camera systems. Current data augmentation methods focus on 2D motion estimation, ignoring the 3D nature of camera and object movements, leading to unrealistic motion patterns.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid simulation-augmentation approach to generate diverse, realistic blur datasets by integrating physics-based rendering engines with machine learning-based augmentation methods. Utilize 3D modeling software to create various dynamic scenes and simulate camera and object movements in three dimensions. Then, apply generative adversarial networks (GANs) to modify these simulations with learned patterns of real-world blur, thus combining authentic scene geometry with sophisticated motion blur variations.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict the parameters of blur based on a dataset of 3D motion captures, then use these parameters to drive a physics-based rendering engine for generating synthetic blur in diverse scenes.",
