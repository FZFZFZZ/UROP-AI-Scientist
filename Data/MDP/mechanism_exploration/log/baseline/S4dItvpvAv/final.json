  "target_idea": "Investigate the geometric structure of the Pareto front in MO-MDPs, revealing it as the boundary of a convex polytope with vertices corresponding to deterministic policies. Develop an efficient algorithm that identifies these vertices by solving a single-objective MDP once and traversing the Pareto front's edges, significantly reducing the complexity of finding the exact Pareto front.",
  "context": "Multi-Objective Markov Decision Processes (MO-MDPs) are increasingly important for real-world decision-making problems involving conflicting objectives. The Pareto front is crucial for identifying non-dominated policies, but finding it is challenging. Existing methods either rely on impractical continuous preference space traversal or focus only on deterministic policies, lacking techniques to fully characterize the Pareto front. Additionally, the structure of the Pareto front remains unclear even when the MDP is fully known.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive clustering-based MO-MDP algorithm that identifies regions in the preferences space where the Pareto front's structure changes significantly. This algorithm would dynamically allocate more computational resources to these regions to refine the Pareto front estimation efficiently. It could use machine learning models to predict the complexity and the morphology of the Pareto front based on initial sparse sampling, thereby optimizing the overall search process in multi-objective decision landscapes.",
  "final_idea": "Propose a theoretical framework for analyzing the geometric properties of the Pareto front in MO-MDPs, such as curvature and dimensionality, to provide insights into its complexity and guide the development of more efficient algorithms.",
