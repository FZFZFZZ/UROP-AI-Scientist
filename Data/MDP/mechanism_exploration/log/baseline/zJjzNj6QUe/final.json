  "target_idea": "Propose RocketEval, an automated evaluation method using a lightweight LLM as a judge, which reframes evaluation tasks as multi-faceted Q&A with instance-specific checklists. This method addresses judgment accuracy issues by using checklist grading and reweighting to align with supervised annotations.",
  "context": "Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in diverse scenarios is crucial for aligning them with human preferences. Traditional human evaluations are costly, leading to the use of powerful LLMs as judges, which also presents challenges such as high expenses, privacy concerns, and reproducibility issues.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a decentralized evaluation framework using blockchain technology where language model evaluations are crowdsourced through a distributed network of evaluators. Each evaluator, potentially anonymous but vetted through cryptographic proofs to ensure expertise and impartiality, would assess small parts of model outputs. This method would reduce costs, enhance privacy and security of evaluative data, and increase the scalability and reliability of evaluations by distributing the load and avoiding centralized biases.",
  "final_idea": "Create a meta-evaluation protocol that uses a variety of smaller, specialized LLMs to assess different aspects of a larger LLM's performance, thus reducing the computational cost and improving evaluation granularity.",
