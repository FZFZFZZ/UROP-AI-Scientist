  "target_idea": "Introduce Probe Pruning (PP), a framework for online, dynamic, structured pruning of LLMs that operates in a batch-wise manner. PP involves three stages: probing to identify crucial hidden states, history-informed pruning to integrate these states with historical data, and full inference on the pruned model. This method allows for efficient pruning without additional neural network modules or fine-tuning, leveraging a PP importance score to assess weight channel importance.",
  "context": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are computationally intensive, and not all samples and tokens contribute equally to the model's output. Efficiently pruning these models without compromising performance is a significant challenge, as it requires identifying and removing less important weights while maintaining the model's effectiveness.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive, insight-driven pruning methodology where the LLM dynamically identifies and prunes less significant weights during actual runtime based on the semantic complexity and contextual demands of the input queries. By using real-time computational resource monitoring and feedback loops, the model can adjust the granularity of its network, simplifying itself for less complex tasks and reverting to full capacity for high-complexity needs. This approach allows for a scalable LLM deployment that optimizes both computational efficiency and performance, adapting its structure to best fit the task at hand.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a hybrid pruning approach combining both static and dynamic methodologies: Initially apply a static pruning based on historical data and global importance scores to reduce the model size, followed by a dynamic, context-sensitive pruning during runtime that adjusts to the specific requirements of incoming queries.",
