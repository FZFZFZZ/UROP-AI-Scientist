Best idea:
Incorporate a rule-extraction algorithm that translates the behaviors of deep neural networks into human-readable rules or guidelines. This algorithm would analyze the network layers to derive comprehensive sets of decision rules, making the model's operations transparent and understandable in critical applications.
