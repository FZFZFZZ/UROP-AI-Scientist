  "target_idea": "Define workflows as an activity-on-vertex (AOV) graph to enable continuous refinement by LLM agents through dynamic subtask allocation adjustments. Emphasize modularity in workflow design to enhance performance by evaluating parallelism and dependency complexity, allowing efficient concurrent execution and improved error tolerance.",
  "context": "Multi-agent frameworks utilizing large language models have been successful in automated planning and task execution. However, there is a lack of study on effectively adjusting agentic workflows during execution, which is crucial for adapting to unforeseen challenges and changing conditions in real-world scenarios.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic adjustment protocol for multi-agent systems that incorporates a \"metacognitive layer\" where agents can assess and reevaluate their own performance and decisions in real time. This layer would use machine learning to predict potential failures or inefficiencies in the agents' strategies based on ongoing tasks and environmental feedback. The system would autonomously adjust individual agents' roles and responsibilities, allowing the entire framework to adaptively optimize its workflow and improve task execution under varying conditions.",
  "final_idea": "Establish a modular task decomposition framework in multi-agent systems, where tasks are dynamically broken down or merged based on real-time effectiveness evaluations, allowing the system to adapt to changing operational demands efficiently.",
