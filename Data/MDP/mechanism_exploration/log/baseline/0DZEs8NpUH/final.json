  "target_idea": "Introduce the concept of Personality Alignment, which customizes LLMs' responses to match individual user preferences by utilizing the Personality Alignment with Personality Inventories (PAPI) dataset. Develop an activation intervention optimization method, PAS, to enhance LLMs' alignment with individual behavioral preferences efficiently, using minimal data and computational resources.",
  "context": "Large language models (LLMs) are generally designed to reflect broad human values and behaviors, but they often struggle to capture the unique characteristics and preferences of individual users. This limitation presents challenges in personalizing AI interactions to align with individual user preferences, especially given the constraints of limited personal data, diverse user preferences, and scalability requirements.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive \"user persona\" framework for LLMs that constructs and refines dynamic, pseudo-individual profiles based on minimal user interactions. Utilizing few-shot learning techniques, the framework would initially extrapolate a provisional user persona from early interactions and subsequently refine this persona through ongoing dialogue, leveraging user corrections and implicit feedback to enhance model personalization. This approach minimizes the need for extensive personal data collection while allowing the AI to adaptively align with evolving user preferences and behaviors over time.",
  "final_idea": "Integrate psychometric analysis into the LLM framework to better understand and predict user preferences based on psychological traits, thus tailoring responses more accurately to individual users.",
