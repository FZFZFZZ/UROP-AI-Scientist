  "target_idea": "Develop more effective canaries under realistic threat models to improve the detection of privacy leakage in LLMs, setting a new standard for measuring memorization rates and providing a more accurate privacy audit.",
  "context": "Current privacy auditing techniques for large language models (LLMs) are limited in effectiveness due to their reliance on basic canary generation methods. These methods result in weak membership inference attacks, providing only loose lower bounds on empirical privacy leakage.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dual-phase approach for privacy auditing in LLMs that combines differential privacy mechanisms with adversarial training. In the first phase, inject noise into the training data using advanced differential privacy techniques to obscure individual data points. In the second phase, train an adversarial model specifically to execute membership inference attacks on the LLM, assessing the robustness of the noise application. The effectiveness and resilience of the LLM against privacy breaches can thus be quantitatively measured, allowing for more precise adjustments and enhancements in the model's privacy-preserving protocols.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a multi-layered canary generation approach that uses both synthetic and real-world data, enhancing the simulation of sophisticated attacker strategies in privacy auditing environments.",
