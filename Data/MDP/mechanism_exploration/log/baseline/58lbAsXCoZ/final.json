  "target_idea": "Propose a neural physical simulation framework using implicit neural representation, constructing a parameterized vector field with exterior calculus and the Closest Point Method to ensure divergence-free properties and enable simulations on various surface representations. Implement a covariant derivative-based advection process for surface flow dynamics and energy preservation, achieving higher accuracy, flexibility, and memory efficiency with low energy dissipation.",
  "context": "Incompressible fluid simulation on surfaces is crucial for visual effects, liquid crystal film design, and scientific analysis of atmospheric and oceanic phenomena. This task faces challenges such as extending physical laws to 3D surfaces and preserving energy and volume. Traditional methods using grids or meshes for spatial discretization suffer from high memory consumption and lack robustness and adaptability across different mesh qualities and representations. Implicit representation-based simulators offer storage efficiency and continuity but struggle with surface simulation and energy dissipation.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid simulation framework that combines implicit representation for incompressible fluid dynamics with a dynamic tessellation layer that refines and coarsens based on local fluid properties and curvature of the surface. This method would utilize machine learning algorithms trained on high-resolution mesh simulations to automatically adjust the tessellation density, ensuring optimal mesh quality and minimizing memory usage while preserving energy and volume. The framework will include an adaptive feedback system to iteratively improve simulation accuracy and computational efficiency based on real-time analysis of flow characteristics and surface interactions.",
  "final_idea": "Create a physics-informed neural network model specifically designed for surface-based incompressible fluid simulations, which learns from both implicit and mesh-based data, and dynamically adapts its structure to optimize for energy conservation and computational efficiency in real-time simulations.",
