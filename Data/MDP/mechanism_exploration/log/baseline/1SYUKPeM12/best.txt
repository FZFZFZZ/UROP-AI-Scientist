Best idea:
Introduce a modular neural network design that employs separate encoders for audio and visual data, each fine-tuned on domain-specific tasks before integration. This approach could include a reinforcement learning stage where the model is rewarded for accurately predicting outcomes based on the combined multimodal inputs, focusing on reducing semantic hallucinations by refining the decision boundaries between modalities.
