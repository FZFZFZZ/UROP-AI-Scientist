  "target_idea": "Introduce a fine-grained AV-LLM called Dolphin, which aligns audio and visual modalities in both temporal and spatial dimensions using an audio-visual multi-scale adapter and interleaved merging. Additionally, develop an audio-visual caption and instruction-tuning dataset, AVU, with 5.2 million diverse data tuples and a novel data partitioning strategy.",
  "context": "Audio plays a crucial role in multimodal video understanding, providing complementary information to visual data. Current Video-LLMs and AV-LLMs struggle to effectively utilize audio information, resulting in poor comprehension and hallucinations.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hierarchical attention-based neural network that dynamically weights the contribution of audio and visual signals in real-time during video analysis. This model would employ a dual-pathway architecture where one pathway processes visual information and the other processes auditory information, each with its own attention mechanism. The outputs of these pathways would then converge in a fusion layer, which utilizes a meta-attention system that learns the optimal way to integrate these modal signals based on the current context, potentially enhancing the model's ability to adapt to videos where audio provides crucial disambiguating information.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a modular neural network design that employs separate encoders for audio and visual data, each fine-tuned on domain-specific tasks before integration. This approach could include a reinforcement learning stage where the model is rewarded for accurately predicting outcomes based on the combined multimodal inputs, focusing on reducing semantic hallucinations by refining the decision boundaries between modalities.",
