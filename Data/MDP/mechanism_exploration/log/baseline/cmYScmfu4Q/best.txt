Best idea:
Develop a Hybrid Reward Inference and Preference Optimization (HRIPO) framework that combines the strengths of RLHF and DPO for training language models. This framework would alternate between direct preference optimization on tasks with clear outcomes or user preferences, and reward inference-based learning where human feedback is ambiguous or sparse. Such an approach could provide a balanced mechanism, reducing the overfitting risk in continuously changing data distributions while also ensuring robustness in model behaviour through direct optimization in better-understood scenarios.
