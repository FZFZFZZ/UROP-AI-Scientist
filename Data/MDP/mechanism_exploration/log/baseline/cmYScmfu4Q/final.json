  "target_idea": "Develop two RLHF algorithms that bypass reward inference for broader RL problems, using human preferences to estimate local value function differences and approximate policy gradients with a zeroth-order gradient approximator.",
  "context": "Reward inference is a crucial step in the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) process for fine-tuning Large Language Models. However, RLHF encounters challenges like distribution shift, reward model overfitting, and problem misspecification. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a simpler alternative by optimizing policies directly without reward inference, but it is limited to specific settings like bandits or deterministic MDPs.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a Hybrid Reward Inference and Preference Optimization (HRIPO) framework that combines the strengths of RLHF and DPO for training language models. This framework would alternate between direct preference optimization on tasks with clear outcomes or user preferences, and reward inference-based learning where human feedback is ambiguous or sparse. Such an approach could provide a balanced mechanism, reducing the overfitting risk in continuously changing data distributions while also ensuring robustness in model behaviour through direct optimization in better-understood scenarios.",
