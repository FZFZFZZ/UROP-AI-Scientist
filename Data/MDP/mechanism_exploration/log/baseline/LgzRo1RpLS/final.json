  "target_idea": "Introduce MambaExtend, a framework that enhances Mamba's context extension capabilities by using a training-free approach to calibrate the scaling factors of discretization modules across different layers. This method employs both gradient-based and gradient-free zeroth-order optimization to determine optimal scaling factors, enabling significant context extension with minimal updates and reduced memory usage.",
  "context": "The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in transformer models has led researchers to explore alternative architectures with sub-quadratic complexity, such as state-space models. Mamba is a leading model in this area, achieving state-of-the-art results in language modeling benchmarks. However, its performance is limited by its pre-training context length, causing degradation when handling longer contexts due to out-of-distribution discretization steps.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic discretization framework for the Mamba model where the discretization granularity automatically adjusts based on the sequence length and content complexity. This framework would use a small neural network to predict the optimal discretization steps for each specific context, thereby preserving important information in longer sequences without unnecessary complexity in shorter ones. The dynamic approach aims to mitigate performance degradation in longer contexts and improve the overall efficiency and adaptability of the model in handling diverse data sets.",
  "final_idea": "Explore the integration of a continuous learning module in the Mamba model that adjusts the parameters of the discretization process based on feedback from downstream tasks, potentially enhancing the model's ability to handle longer contexts without significant performance drops.",
