  "target_idea": "Develop information-theoretic methods to establish regret lower bounds and introduce the first Bayesian regret lower bounds based on accumulated information. Additionally, derive regret upper bounds using the information gathered by the agent, demonstrating that information can be exchanged for reduced regret.",
  "context": "In sequential decision problems, agents perform tasks repeatedly, experiencing regret and gaining information that can be used in future rounds. Sometimes, agents can also gather information from external sources to avoid regret. The challenge lies in balancing the information accumulated by the agent with the regret experienced.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-decision framework that uses AI-modulated selective memory reinforcement, where an agent dynamically regulates the information it retains or forgets after each decision-making iteration based on a pre-defined regret threshold. This AI system would incrementally adjust its memory retention strategies by referencing both internal performance metrics (past regrets and successes) and external informational cues. The system integrates real-time feedback loops to update its strategies, effectively balancing the cognitive load and optimizing decision efficacy across varied and unpredictable environments.",
  "final_idea": "Explore the use of information theory to quantify the value of information in sequential decision problems, linking it to the rate of regret reduction and proposing new metrics for evaluating decision-making strategies.",
