Develop an AI-driven tool that utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to improve the automated conversion of 3D assets from voxel-based or point cloud formats to industry-standard meshes. This tool would be trained on a dataset of high-quality meshes crafted by human artists across various genres and styles to learn the nuances of artistic mesh crafting, ensuring that the conversion process not only preserves but enhances geometric details and reduces unnecessary polygon density. Additionally, the tool could be equipped with a feature that allows for real-time feedback and adjustments from the user, making it a collaborative AI-human interface that continuously learns and adaplices to the userâ€™s stylistic preferences and technical requirements.
