  "target_idea": "Extend the Weak-to-Strong framework to WeakS-to-Strong by using an ensemble of weak models to simulate human opinion variability, employing a Bayesian approach for confidence scoring, and applying direct preference optimization to enhance preference learning in text generation tasks.",
  "context": "As large language models become more complex, the challenge arises in adapting alignment techniques, especially when human supervision is limited. In scenarios where weak supervision is used, it becomes crucial to effectively harness the capabilities of stronger models.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a self-supervised alignment protocol where the model generates its own training signals by simulating hypothetical user interactions based on narratives constructed from existing data. The system could use an in-built mechanism to generate diverse user personas and interaction scenarios, each designed to challenge and refine different aspects of the model's alignment with human values and expectations. This approach allows the model to adapt to a variety of complex, real-world situations under weak supervision, increasing its robustness and reliability.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce an ensemble method that leverages multiple self-supervised models to collectively learn and adapt, using a consensus mechanism to decide the best alignment strategy in complex interaction scenarios.",
