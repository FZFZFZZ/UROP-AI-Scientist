  "target_idea": "Introduce the Reflective Gaussian splatting (Ref-Gaussian) framework, which includes a physically based deferred rendering approach using split-sum approximation for pixel-level material properties, and a Gaussian-grounded inter-reflection function within a Gaussian splatting paradigm. Additionally, enhance geometry modeling with material-aware normal propagation and an initial per-Gaussian shading stage using 2D Gaussian primitives.",
  "context": "Recent advancements in novel view synthesis have been driven by NeRF- and 3DGS-based methods. Despite these advancements, reconstructing reflective objects remains a challenge, as there is no existing solution that provides real-time, high-quality rendering while handling inter-reflection effectively.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid rendering model that integrates NeRF with adaptive mesh refinement techniques specifically for reflective surfaces. This model could employ AI-driven heuristics to dynamically adjust the density and orientation of meshes based on the estimated reflectivity and angle of incidence observed in real-time viewer interactions. Such a system would allow for precision in reflections and efficient computation, enabling more realistic and responsive rendering of complex reflective objects and environments.",
  "final_idea": "Incorporate a physics-based simulation within the NeRF framework to more accurately model the light transport and surface properties of reflective objects, using precomputed radiance transfer (PRT) techniques to handle complex inter-reflections in real-time environments.",
