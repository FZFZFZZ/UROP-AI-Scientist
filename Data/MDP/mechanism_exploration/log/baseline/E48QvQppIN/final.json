  "target_idea": "Introduce Clone-informed Bayesian Optimization (CloneBO), a method that leverages a generative model trained on clonal families to optimize antibody sequences. This approach uses a large language model, CloneLM, to design mutations that align with the immune system's natural optimization process, and incorporates a twisted sequential Monte Carlo procedure to guide designs based on previous measurements.",
  "context": "Biologists aim to develop effective therapeutics by iteratively mutating antibody sequences to enhance their binding and stability. This process can be guided by previous experimental data or by learning from extensive antibody databases, but the vastness of the typical antibody space makes it challenging to find suitable antibodies within budget constraints.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an AI-driven platform that utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN) to simulate the evolution of antibody sequences. This platform would pit generated antibodies against a set of evolving virtual antigens, mimicking real biological arms races. This approach would allow researchers to observe how antibody mutations might fare against evolving pathogens in a computationally efficient and cost-effective manner, thereby predicting more viable antibody candidates for further experimental validation.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a Bayesian optimization strategy to systematically explore the antibody sequence space, using prior experimental data to update the probability model and efficiently guide the search towards optimal mutations.",
