  "target_idea": "Introduce PruneNet, a novel model compression method that reformulates model pruning as a policy learning process, decoupling it from the model architecture and eliminating the need for calibration datasets. PruneNet learns a stochastic pruning policy to assess parameter importance based on intrinsic model properties, preserving the spectral structure to minimize information loss.",
  "context": "The increasing size of large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges for deployment due to their high computational and memory demands. Existing model pruning techniques often rely on external calibration datasets to determine which parameters to prune, limiting their flexibility and scalability across different compression ratios. These methods can also lead to severe performance degradation, especially in downstream tasks, when subjected to higher compression rates.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic, self-adjusting pruning approach for large language models that utilizes reinforcement learning to adaptively identify and prune less critical parameters in real-time, based on the model's performance on a rolling window of recent tasks or inputs. This method would not rely on static external datasets but would continuously learn from recent outputs and adapt to preserve performance across different tasks and compression levels. The reinforcement learning agent would optimize a policy to balance model size and computational efficiency against task-specific performance metrics, thus effectively managing the trade-offs dynamically.",
