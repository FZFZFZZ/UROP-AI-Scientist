Best idea:
Develop a dynamic, self-adjusting pruning approach for large language models that utilizes reinforcement learning to adaptively identify and prune less critical parameters in real-time, based on the model's performance on a rolling window of recent tasks or inputs. This method would not rely on static external datasets but would continuously learn from recent outputs and adapt to preserve performance across different tasks and compression levels. The reinforcement learning agent would optimize a policy to balance model size and computational efficiency against task-specific performance metrics, thus effectively managing the trade-offs dynamically.
