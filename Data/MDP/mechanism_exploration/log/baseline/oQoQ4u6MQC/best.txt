Best idea:
Explore the use of transfer learning by pre-training the diffusion model on a diverse dataset of images and styles, and then fine-tuning it with user-specific reference images and text descriptions. This could potentially improve the model's ability to generalize from abstract concepts to specific visual attributes while maintaining diversity.
