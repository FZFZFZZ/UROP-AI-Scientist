  "target_idea": "Introduce a method that enables a pretrained T2I diffusion model to learn a set of soft prompts, which allows for the generation of novel images by sampling from the learned prompt distribution. This approach provides text-guided editing capabilities and flexibility in controlling variation and mixing between multiple distributions, with adaptability to other tasks such as text-to-3D.",
  "context": "Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have become popular for generating high-quality images from text descriptions. Despite their success, these models struggle with creating diverse and customized images that incorporate specific visual attributes from reference images. The challenge lies in personalizing these models to adapt abstract concepts or categories while maintaining sufficient variation in the generated images.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hierarchical text-to-image diffusion model that uses a two-tiered approach to address customization and diversity. The first tier would interpret the text description and reference images to extract and synthesize key visual attributes (like color schemes, textures, or specific style elements). The second tier would then use this synthesized attribute palette to guide the diffusion process, ensuring that each generated image not only aligns with the abstract concepts or categories described in the text but also retains variation in visual representation, leading to both high personalization and diversity in output.",
  "final_idea": "Explore the use of transfer learning by pre-training the diffusion model on a diverse dataset of images and styles, and then fine-tuning it with user-specific reference images and text descriptions. This could potentially improve the model's ability to generalize from abstract concepts to specific visual attributes while maintaining diversity.",
