  "target_idea": "Generalize the framework to include generating functions that are neither submodular nor supermodular, creating a more flexible divergence called the difference-of-submodular Bregman divergence. Introduce a learnable form of this divergence using permutation-invariant neural networks to capture structural properties in discrete data.",
  "context": "The Bregman divergence is a pseudo-distance commonly used for comparing vectors or functions in continuous spaces, generated from a convex function. However, defining a similar divergence for discrete spaces is challenging. Previous work by Iyer & Bilmes explored Bregman divergences on discrete domains using submodular functions, which are discrete analogs of convex functions.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a framework for generalized Bregman divergences in mixed spaces, combining both continuous and discrete elements. Use a hybrid function that gracefully transitions between convex functions for continuous variables and submodular functions for discrete variables. This would allow for the creation of a new class of divergences that can be applied to complex data types, such as graphs with attributes on nodes and edges that are both categorical and continuous.",
  "final_idea": "Extend the framework of generalized Bregman divergences to include a learning component that dynamically adjusts the balance between convex and submodular functions based on data characteristics. This adaptive approach could enhance the divergence's flexibility and accuracy in diverse applications.",
