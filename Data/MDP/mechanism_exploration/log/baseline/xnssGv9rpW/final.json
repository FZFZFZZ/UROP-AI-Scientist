  "target_idea": "Propose SymmCD, a diffusion-based generative model that integrates crystallographic symmetry into the generation process by decomposing crystals into the asymmetric unit and the necessary symmetry transformations, using a novel representation to generalize across different symmetry groups.",
  "context": "Generating novel crystalline materials is crucial for advancements in electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. Crystals are defined by their symmetry, which significantly influences their physical properties. Current methods for crystal generation either fail to produce materials with real-world crystal symmetries or merely replicate symmetry information from existing databases.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an AI-driven platform that uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create novel crystalline structures. The AI will be trained on a mixture of existing crystallography data and hypothetical models that comply with fundamental crystallographic rules but vary symmetry elements, thereby pushing the envelope of possible crystal architectures. This approach will allow for the exploration of uncharted crystalline materials with potentially unique and desirable properties for specific applications in electronics and catalysis.",
