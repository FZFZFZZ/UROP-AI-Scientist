  "target_idea": "Introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), an algorithm that approximates the optimal estimator by first predicting the posterior mean and then transporting it to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model, which approximates the optimal transport map.",
  "context": "Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are evaluated by distortion measures like PSNR and SSIM, as well as perceptual quality measures such as FID and NIQE. The goal is to minimize distortion without compromising perceptual quality. Current methods often sample from the posterior distribution or optimize a weighted sum of distortion and perceptual quality losses. However, achieving an optimal estimator that minimizes MSE while ensuring the reconstructed images' distribution matches the ground-truth is a challenge.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic balancing algorithm that adaptively adjusts the weighting between distortion and perceptual quality metrics during the training of image restoration models based on the input image characteristics. This algorithm would use reinforcement learning to tune the weights in real-time, learning from the degree of degradation and content type in the images. By optimizing weights dynamically, the model can provide tailor-made restoration that optimally balances sharpness and naturalness specific to each image, potentially yielding superior results where static weighting schemes fail.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a Bayesian deep learning framework that incorporates uncertainty estimates in the optimization of distortion and perceptual quality. This approach could provide a probabilistic interpretation of the trade-offs involved, potentially leading to more robust and reliable restoration outcomes.",
