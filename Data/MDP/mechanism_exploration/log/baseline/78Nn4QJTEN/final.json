  "target_idea": "Investigate the emergence of attention sinks in language models and propose replacing softmax attention with alternative operations like sigmoid attention without normalization to prevent the formation of attention sinks in models up to 1B parameters.",
  "context": "Auto-regressive language models often exhibit a phenomenon known as 'attention sink,' where significant attention is given to the first token regardless of its semantic importance. This issue is prevalent in various applications like streaming generation and model optimization, yet a comprehensive understanding of it is lacking. Attention sinks are observed universally across different models and emerge during pre-training, influenced by factors such as optimization, data distribution, and model architecture.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic attention regulation mechanism that applies an adaptive decay rate to attention weights based on their temporal sequence positions and the semantic relevance of each token. This approach uses reinforcement learning to adjust the decay rate in real-time, aiming to minimize the reliance on positional biases and enhance the focus on semantically relevant tokens. The model will train on a feedback loop that evaluates the semantic contribution of tokens to model outputs, encouraging a more contextually appropriate distribution of attention across the sequence.",
  "final_idea": "Explore the use of a modified transformer architecture with a bifurcated attention pathway, one for the initial token and another for the rest, to balance the attention distribution more effectively during pre-training.",
