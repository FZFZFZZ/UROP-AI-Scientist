  "target_idea": "Introduce SpodNet, a novel and generic learning module that ensures SPD outputs while supporting additional structural constraints, such as element-wise sparsity, effectively addressing the challenge of learning jointly SPD and sparse matrices.",
  "context": "Estimating matrices within the symmetric positive-definite (SPD) cone is crucial for various applications, including computer vision and graph learning. Traditional convex optimization-based estimators are limited in expressivity due to their model-based nature. Designing neural architectures for SPD learning is challenging, especially when additional structural constraints like element-wise sparsity are required. Existing methods either fail to ensure all desired properties or lack expressivity.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid neural architecture that combines graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with Riemannian geometry-based layers specifically designed for SPD matrices. This architecture would employ a dynamic sparsity-promoting regularization technique which adapts the level of sparsity during training based on the learning progress and geometric properties of the SPD manifold. The use of GCNs helps in leveraging local structural information within the data, while the specialized Riemannian layers ensure the output remains within the SPD cone, optimizing both expressivity and adherence to structural constraints.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a modular neural network architecture specifically tailored for SPD matrix estimation, incorporating plug-and-play components that enforce sparsity and SPD constraints at different layers of the network, potentially using a combination of projection-based methods and regularization techniques.",
