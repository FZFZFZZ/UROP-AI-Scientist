Best idea:
Develop a method that intentionally induces a controlled form of neural collapse during the training of image-based control systems by incorporating a regularization term that encourages the clustering of visual representations not just by action labels, but also by predicted outcome or state-transition dynamics. This would enable the network to form more discriminative features for control tasks, potentially enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the system to changes in environment or task parameters. Furthermore, investigate whether the degree of induced clustering can be dynamically adjusted based on real-time performance metrics, allowing the system to adapt to new or evolving tasks.
