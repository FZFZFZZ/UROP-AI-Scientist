  "target_idea": "Leverage the observed law of clustering as an algorithmic tool by pretraining the vision encoder using neural collapse as a regularization technique to encourage control-oriented clustering of visual features, thereby improving test-time performance when training a policy with limited expert demonstrations.",
  "context": "In image-based control pipelines learned from behavior cloning, the geometry of the visual representation space serves as the information channel between the vision encoder and the action decoder. Inspired by neural collapse in image classification, there is an observed phenomenon where visual representations cluster according to action labels in discrete control tasks and according to control-oriented classes in continuous control tasks.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a method that intentionally induces a controlled form of neural collapse during the training of image-based control systems by incorporating a regularization term that encourages the clustering of visual representations not just by action labels, but also by predicted outcome or state-transition dynamics. This would enable the network to form more discriminative features for control tasks, potentially enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the system to changes in environment or task parameters. Furthermore, investigate whether the degree of induced clustering can be dynamically adjusted based on real-time performance metrics, allowing the system to adapt to new or evolving tasks.",
