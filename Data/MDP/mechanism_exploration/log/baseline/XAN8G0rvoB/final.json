  "target_idea": "Propose the Knockoff Inference-based Training data Detector (KTD), a method that ensures rigorous false discovery rate control in training data detection by generating synthetic knockoff samples to replace original data points while maintaining contextual integrity. A novel knockoff statistic is used to achieve FDR control and maintain high power.",
  "context": "Detecting training data for large language models is increasingly important, particularly in applications that demand high reliability. Existing methods primarily focus on accuracy but often lack the ability to provide controllable results.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning framework that utilizes a combination of reinforcement learning and supervised learning to adaptively refine the detection system's focus toward specific subsets of data likely to compromise model performance. The system would analyze initial detection outputs, learn from areas where false positives or negatives occurred, and then dynamically adjust detection algorithms to improve precision in real-time. This would allow for a more controlled and accurate identification of training data, especially in scenarios where data sensitivity varies substantially.",
  "final_idea": "Adopt an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple detection models, each trained on different aspects of the data, to form a consensus on what constitutes sensitive or problematic data. This collective decision-making process would reduce the likelihood of false positives and increase the overall reliability of the detection.",
