  "target_idea": "Investigate the impact of introducing visual tokens at different stages of pre-training by training models across various datasets, scales, and image-text ratios. Evaluate these models on a range of vision-language and text-only tasks to determine the optimal strategy for integrating visual data into pre-trained LLMs.",
  "context": "Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) that are further trained with image data have shown strong performance on vision-language tasks. However, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of this two-step training process compared to vision-language models (VLMs) that integrate images earlier in the training process. This raises questions about the optimal timing and method for introducing visual data during model training.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid training protocol called Incremental Multimodal Integration (IMI), whereby a language-focused pre-trained model incrementally receives layers specifically designed to integrate and process visual data at various stages of its further training. Begin by introducing basic visual processing layers after initial linguistic fine-tuning and progressively introduce more complex visual integrations as the model's training progresses. This approach mimics human cognitive development where comprehension becomes more sophisticated over time, and allows for a dynamic assessment of the integration pointâ€™s impact on performance across different types of vision-language tasks.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a hybrid training protocol where visual data is gradually introduced in increasing complexity and volume to pre-trained LLMs, and evaluate its effect on model robustness and adaptability across diverse multimodal datasets in comparison to baseline VLMs.",
