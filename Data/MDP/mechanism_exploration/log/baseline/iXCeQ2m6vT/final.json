  "target_idea": "Develop a system using Glimpse-based Active Perception (GAP) that sequentially focuses on salient regions of an image at high resolution, utilizing the locations from these glimpses and the surrounding visual content to represent relations between different image parts.",
  "context": "AI systems struggle with understanding visual relations, particularly when dealing with previously unseen objects, whereas humans excel at this task. Active vision theories suggest that learning visual relations is linked to eye movements that help fixate on objects and their parts, with spatial information from these movements aiding in representing relations between image parts.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an AI system that simulates human-like saccadic movements to improve the understanding of visual relations among objects. By programming the AI to mimic the patterns of quick, simultaneous eye movements performed by humans when scanning unfamiliar scenes, the system can build dynamic spatial maps of unseen objects and learn to contextualize them relative to known objects. This method would allow the AI to incrementally learn and update its database of object relations through an iterative process akin to human visual learning.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a hierarchical attention system in neural networks that first identifies potential regions of interest through coarse saccadic movements and then refines focus through finer, detail-oriented fixations, similar to the zoom-in approach used by human vision.",
