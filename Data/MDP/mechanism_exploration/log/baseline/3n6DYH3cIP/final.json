  "target_idea": "Propose an extendable structure learning strategy that efficiently integrates a new variable into an existing Bayesian network, leveraging existing information to reduce computational overhead. Introduce a novel iterative paradigm for structure learning, starting with a small subset of variables and iteratively adding more to construct a complete P-map graph.",
  "context": "Learning the structure of Bayesian networks is a crucial but computationally demanding task, particularly as the number of variables increases. Traditional methods require complete retraining when new variables are added, making them unsuitable for dynamic or large-scale applications.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a modular Bayesian network framework that utilizes transfer learning and graph neural networks to dynamically incorporate new variables without full retraining. Each variable and its dependencies could be treated as separate but interacting modules within a graph structure. As new variables are introduced, the network adjusts inter-module connections based on learned patterns from previous configurations, thereby reducing the computational burden and adapting more effectively to dynamic data environments.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a hierarchical Bayesian network model that progressively refines its structure by adding layers of complexity with each new variable, utilizing a scalable, layer-wise training approach to manage computational costs.",
