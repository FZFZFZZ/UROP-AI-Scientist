  "target_idea": "Introduce a novel framework called Discriminator-Guided Action Optimization (DGAP) that optimizes LLM action plans using step-wise signals. This involves using a limited set of demonstrations to train a discriminator to learn a score function, which evaluates the alignment between LLM-generated actions and optimal actions at each step, guiding LLMs to generate actions that maximize this score.",
  "context": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities across various fields but struggle with complex embodied tasks that require a coherent long-term strategy and context-sensitive understanding of the environment. Previous approaches to refining LLMs have relied on outcome-supervised feedback, which can be both costly and ineffective.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid training framework that combines LLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) agents trained in simulated environments. Initially, LLMs can guide the RL agents by predicting plausible actions based on textual descriptions of the environment and the desired outcome. Over time, the RL agent refines its strategies through trial and error while providing feedback to the LLM, enhancing its ability to propose more contextually appropriate and strategically sound actions in complex scenarios.",
  "final_idea": "Integrate a dual-pathway architecture in the LLM, where one pathway generates action proposals and the other evaluates these proposals based on historical data and simulated outcomes, enhancing the model's ability to adapt strategies dynamically.",
