  "target_idea": "Introduce UltraMem, a large-scale, ultra-sparse memory layer designed to reduce inference latency while maintaining model performance, and explore its scaling laws to demonstrate superior scaling properties compared to MoE.",
  "context": "Transformer models' performance is known to be logarithmically related to their number of parameters and computational complexity. Although Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches attempt to separate parameter count from computational complexity, they encounter difficulties during inference due to high memory access costs.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a novel transformer architecture that integrates adaptive caching mechanisms during inference to optimize memory access patterns specific to Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. This can involve predicting which experts are most likely to be needed based on the input sequence and pre-fetching the associated parameters into faster-access cache layers. This approach will minimize latency and energy consumption associated with memory accesses, improving both computational efficiency and environmental sustainability of large-scale MoE deployments.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a hybrid MoE model that combines both dense and sparse sub-networks, where critical parameters are processed in high-speed cache memory to expedite inference, while less critical data is handled in slower, more economical storage.",
