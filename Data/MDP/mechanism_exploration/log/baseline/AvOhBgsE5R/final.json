  "target_idea": "Introduce Motion-Agent, a conversational framework that uses a pre-trained language model to create MotionLLM, which encodes and quantizes motions into discrete tokens compatible with the language model's vocabulary. This allows for efficient fine-tuning and integration with GPT-4 to generate complex motion sequences through multi-turn conversations without additional training.",
  "context": "Previous approaches to 3D human motion generation have been successful but often require extensive training and are limited to specific tasks, lacking versatility and efficiency in generating, editing, and understanding human motion.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a modular neural network architecture for 3D human motion generation that uses transfer learning and task-specific tuning to quickly adapt to new motion tasks. This network would consist of a shared base module trained on a diverse set of human movements, with plug-and-play submodules for specific actions or styles, which can be fine-tuned or trained from scratch as necessary. This approach reduces the need for extensive retraining and enhances the system's ability to generate and edit a wide range of human motions efficiently.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a zero-shot learning approach within the modular neural network architecture to handle novel human motion generation tasks without task-specific data. By embedding a semantic understanding of human movements, the network could generalize to new motions based on descriptions or low-dimensional representations, enhancing versatility.",
