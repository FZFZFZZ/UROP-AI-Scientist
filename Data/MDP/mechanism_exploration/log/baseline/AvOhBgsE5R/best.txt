Best idea:
Implement a zero-shot learning approach within the modular neural network architecture to handle novel human motion generation tasks without task-specific data. By embedding a semantic understanding of human movements, the network could generalize to new motions based on descriptions or low-dimensional representations, enhancing versatility.
