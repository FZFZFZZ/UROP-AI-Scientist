  "target_idea": "Conduct a systematic exploration of optimal sparse pre-training configurations for LLMs by examining various pruning schedules across different sparsity levels and training durations. Propose a new scaling law that adapts the Chinchilla scaling law to account for the average parameter count during pre-training, providing a unified model for evaluation loss across both sparsely and densely pre-trained LLMs.",
  "context": "Pruning is a technique used to remove unnecessary parameters in neural networks, addressing the increasing computational demands of large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, many approaches focus on post-training pruning, but sparse pre-training, which integrates pruning with pre-training, offers a simpler alternative.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive multi-stage pruning algorithm for LLMs that integrates selective attention mechanisms with sparse pre-training. This algorithm would dynamically adjust the pruning intensity based on the attention scores derived from each layer of the model during pre-training. By correlating pruning levels with areas of low attention, the model can maintain performance on critical tasks while significantly reducing the overall parameter count and computational load.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a Bayesian optimization framework to determine optimal pruning strategies during the sparse pre-training of LLMs. This framework would use probabilistic modeling to predict the impact of different pruning configurations on model performance, enabling a more systematic and data-driven approach to parameter reduction.",
