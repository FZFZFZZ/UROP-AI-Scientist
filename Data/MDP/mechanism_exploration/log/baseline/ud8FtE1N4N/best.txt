Best idea:
Employ a Bayesian optimization framework to determine optimal pruning strategies during the sparse pre-training of LLMs. This framework would use probabilistic modeling to predict the impact of different pruning configurations on model performance, enabling a more systematic and data-driven approach to parameter reduction.
