  "target_idea": "Introduce the Layerwise Recurrent Router for Mixture-of-Experts (RMoE), which uses a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to create dependencies between routing decisions across layers. This approach allows for efficient parallel computation of layerwise recurrence for input tokens and integrates a novel computation stage that is compatible with existing MoE architectures.",
  "context": "The scaling of large language models has significantly enhanced their capabilities, but this growth necessitates efficient computational strategies. The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is notable for scaling model size without greatly increasing training costs, yet it often suffers from parameter inefficiency. Current MoE models independently assign tokens in different layers without using historical routing information, which can lead to suboptimal token-expert combinations and parameter inefficiency.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic token-routing mechanism for MoE models that utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize expert allocation based on historical data from previous layers. This system can learn optimal routing policies over time by receiving feedback on the effectiveness of past allocations in terms of model performance metrics such as accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, the model can incorporate context-aware and task-specific routing strategies that adapt to the changing data distributions or task requirements, thereby reducing redundancies and improving parameter efficiency across various NLP tasks.",
  "final_idea": "Create a cross-layer coordination mechanism in MoE models that allows token routing decisions to be influenced by the state and needs of other layers. This could help in aligning the routing strategy across the model, optimizing the overall parameter usage and reducing inefficiencies.",
