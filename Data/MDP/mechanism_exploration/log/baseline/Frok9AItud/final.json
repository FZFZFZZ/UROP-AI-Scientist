  "target_idea": "Investigate the preservation of dot product and cosine similarity by random projections on graph matrices, providing new asymptotic and finite-sample results, identifying pathological cases, and applying findings to a ranking application to assess the reliability of embeddings.",
  "context": "Random Projections are commonly used to create embeddings for graph learning tasks due to their efficiency, often justified by the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. However, there is limited understanding of how well these projections preserve dot product and cosine similarity when applied to graph matrices.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a novel random projection method tailored specifically for graph matrices that incorporates structural information, such as node centrality and community structure, into the projection process. This method would use adaptive, non-linear transformations based on graph topological features before applying a linear random projection. The aim is to enhance the preservation of dot products and cosine similarities between nodes, thus maintaining more accurate relational information in the reduced dimensional space, which could vastly improve the performance of graph learning algorithms on tasks like node classification and link prediction.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a theoretical framework that models the error introduced by different random projection schemes when preserving dot products and cosine similarities in graph matrices, incorporating graph-specific properties like sparsity and node connectivity.",
