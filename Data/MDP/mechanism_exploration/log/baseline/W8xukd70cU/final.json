  "target_idea": "Introduce a novel physics-informed offline reinforcement learning framework for optimizing energy efficiency in data center cooling systems. This framework uses a graph neural network architecture to model complex dynamical patterns and physical dependencies, enabling sample-efficient and robust offline policy learning with limited operational data.",
  "context": "The data center industry is rapidly expanding due to advances in information technology and artificial intelligence, leading to a significant increase in electricity consumption, particularly for cooling systems. In typical data centers, 30-40% of energy is used for cooling rather than computing, highlighting the need for energy-saving optimization technologies. However, optimizing these systems is challenging due to the lack of reliable simulation environments, limited historical data, and strict safety and control requirements.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a self-adaptive artificial intelligence system that dynamically adjusts cooling parameters in real-time based on predictive analytics and machine learning, using both external temperature forecasts and internal workload predictions. This AI system would be integrated with IoT sensors strategically placed throughout the data center to continuously monitor heat output at various points, enabling a fine-grained control of cooling resources. This approach maximizes energy efficiency by adapting cooling efforts to anticipated needs rather than reacting to existing conditions, significantly reducing energy consumption and optimizing operational costs.",
  "final_idea": "Employ reinforcement learning techniques to autonomously optimize the trade-offs between energy consumption and cooling needs in data centers, using simulated environments to train models before deployment.",
