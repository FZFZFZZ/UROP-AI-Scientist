Best idea:
Develop an optimization-driven rendering system that employs differentiable path tracing combined with gradient-based learning algorithms. This system would specifically target the minimization of error in the intrinsic components (geometry, material properties, and lighting), allowing for more precise adjustments based on observed image discrepancies.
