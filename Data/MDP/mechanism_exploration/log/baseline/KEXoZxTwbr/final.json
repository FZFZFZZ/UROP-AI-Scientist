  "target_idea": "Introduce MIRReS, a two-stage framework that first extracts an explicit triangular mesh and then refines it using a physically-based inverse rendering model with multi-bounce path tracing and Monte Carlo integration. This approach incorporates reservoir sampling to address noise and improve convergence, enabling accurate estimation of indirect illumination effects and efficient gradient-based optimization.",
  "context": "Previous methods for inverse rendering from multi-view images often relied on implicit irradiance fields or simplified ray tracing, which limited their ability to accurately capture complex lighting interactions such as self-shadowing and internal reflections. These approaches struggled with noise issues and were not well-suited for efficient optimization, making it challenging to achieve precise intrinsic decomposition of geometry, materials, and lighting.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an advanced inverse rendering framework that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) with physically based rendering techniques to enhance the modeling of complex light interactions. This framework would use GNNs to infer relationships and dependencies between different components of the scene, such as geometry, materials, and light paths, enabling more accurate predictions of difficult phenomena like caustics and interreflections. This approach could also integrate adaptive sampling strategies where more computational resources are dynamically allocated to more complex parts of the scene, significantly reducing noise and improving the efficiency of the optimization process.",
  "final_idea": "Develop an optimization-driven rendering system that employs differentiable path tracing combined with gradient-based learning algorithms. This system would specifically target the minimization of error in the intrinsic components (geometry, material properties, and lighting), allowing for more precise adjustments based on observed image discrepancies.",
