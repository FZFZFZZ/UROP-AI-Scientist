  "target_idea": "Introduce SplatFormer, the first point transformer model designed to operate on Gaussian splats, which refines an initial 3DGS set optimized under limited training views in a single forward pass, effectively removing artifacts in OOD test views.",
  "context": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently advanced photorealistic reconstruction, offering high visual fidelity and real-time performance. However, a significant challenge arises as rendering quality declines when test views differ from the camera angles used during training, which is problematic for immersive free-viewpoint rendering and navigation. Existing methods, even those with regularization techniques and data-driven priors, struggle to generalize effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) views.",
  "initial_idea": "To address the decline in rendering quality for out-of-distribution views in 3D Gaussian Splatting, develop a dynamic fine-tuning system that employs reinforcement learning. As a user navigates through a 3D environment, the system receives real-time feedback on visual fidelity and rendering quality at various camera angles. This adaptive model then continuously fine-tunes the existing neural network's weights specifically for the angles and positions least similar to the training data, optimizing performance for out-of-distribution views based on the immediate user interaction and visual experience feedback.",
  "final_idea": "Explore the use of attention mechanisms in the 3DGS model that can dynamically focus on relevant features of the input data depending on the viewpoint, potentially allowing the model to better handle the variability introduced by OOD views.",
