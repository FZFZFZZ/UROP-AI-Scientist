Introduce a dynamic, adaptive decoding framework that uses an initial lightweight model to predict the complexity and resource needs of each input in real-time. Based on this prediction, the framework dynamically chooses an appropriate decoding strategy from a spectrum ranging from fast and less computationally intensive to slow and more detailed, optimizing both computational efficiency and output quality. This approach not only tailors the decoding procedure to the specific requirements of each input but also can significantly reduce unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining high-quality outputs across diverse tasks.
