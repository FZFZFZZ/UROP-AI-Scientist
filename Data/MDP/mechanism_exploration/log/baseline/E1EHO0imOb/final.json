  "target_idea": "Introduce Smooth-SwiGLU, a modification to the SwiGLU activation function, to stabilize FP8 precision training by addressing outlier amplification issues. Additionally, implement FP8 quantization for Adam optimizer moments to enhance training efficiency, enabling successful training of large models with improved throughput.",
  "context": "Large language models have traditionally been trained using higher precision formats, which limits the efficiency and scalability of training on massive datasets. Recent efforts have aimed to reduce precision to improve computational efficiency, but this has introduced new challenges, such as training instabilities that arise over extended periods.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic precision scaling algorithm for training large language models where the precision level is adapted based on the phase of training and the specific data segment being processed. Early training stages could use lower precision to quickly learn from vast datasets, while later stages could switch to higher precision for fine-tuning on more subtle linguistic features. Additionally, implement an AI-driven monitoring system to detect when lower precision is causing undesirable model behavior or training instabilities, prompting an adaptive adjustment back to higher precision to stabilize learning.",
  "final_idea": "Design a set of adaptive activation functions that can adjust their behavior based on the precision of the input, potentially using meta-learning techniques to learn optimal function parameters for each precision setting.",
