  "target_idea": "Introduce DriveTransformer, a simplified E2E-AD framework that enhances scalability through task parallelism, sparse representation, and streaming processing. This framework employs three unified operations: task self-attention, sensor cross-attention, and temporal cross-attention, which collectively reduce system complexity and improve training stability.",
  "context": "End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) is gaining traction as a scalable, data-driven approach to designing autonomous systems. However, current E2E-AD methods typically follow a sequential perception-prediction-planning paradigm, which can result in cumulative errors and unstable training. Additionally, the manual ordering of tasks restricts the system's ability to exploit synergies between tasks, and the dense BEV representation used by these methods poses computational challenges for long-range perception and temporal fusion.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic, graph-based task scheduling framework for end-to-end autonomous driving systems that utilizes real-time performance metrics to adaptively reorder the perception, prediction, and planning tasks. This framework could use reinforcement learning to continuously optimize task sequences based on current environmental contexts and system states, aiming to reduce cumulative errors and enhance system adaptability. Additionally, integrate sparse coding techniques with the dense BEV representation to efficiently encode and process long-range sensor data, improving computational efficiency and temporal depth in environmental understanding.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a modular neural network architecture that processes multi-sensor data in parallel, using lightweight, task-specific subnetworks that dynamically interact based on contextual demands, thereby reducing reliance on heavy BEV representations and improving system responsiveness.",
