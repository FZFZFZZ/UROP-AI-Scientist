  "target_idea": "Propose an RL fine-tuning method called Online Reward-Weighted Conditional Flow Matching with Wasserstein-2 Regularization (ORW-CFM-W2), which integrates RL into the flow matching framework to fine-tune generative models with arbitrary reward functions. The method introduces an online reward-weighting mechanism to prioritize high-reward regions and incorporates Wasserstein-2 distance regularization to prevent policy collapse and maintain diversity.",
  "context": "Recent advancements in reinforcement learning have been successful in fine-tuning diffusion-based generative models. However, challenges persist in fine-tuning continuous flow-based generative models to align with arbitrary user-defined reward functions. These challenges include policy collapse from overoptimization and the high computational cost of likelihoods in continuous-time flows.",
  "initial_idea": "Introduce a dynamic regularization approach during the reinforcement learning fine-tuning process of continuous flow-based generative models. This method would adjust the strength of regularization terms based on real-time monitoring of the flow model's performance metrics and divergence behaviors from desired outputs, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation. By adapting regularization dynamically, this system should prevent policy collapse, reduce the risk of overfitting in specific scenarios, and more effectively manage computational resources during training, potentially increasing the efficiency of adapting models to user-defined reward functions.",
