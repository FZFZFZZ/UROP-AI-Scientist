  "target_idea": "Introduce MaestroMotif, a method that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to design and reuse skills by automatically generating rewards from natural language descriptions and employing code generation and reinforcement learning to train and combine these skills for complex behaviors.",
  "context": "Describing skills in natural language can serve as a means to incorporate human decision-making knowledge into AI systems. This approach aims to make skill design more accessible and effective, particularly in creating adaptable and high-performing agents.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a \"Skill Translator\" AI that converts natural language descriptions directly into executable skill modules for AI agents in simulation environments. This system would use advanced NLP techniques to parse and understand diverse human-described strategies, then map these descriptions onto a structured skill representation that can be dynamically adjusted as the AI learns and adapts. The Skill Translator would facilitate rapid prototyping and iterative development of AI behaviors based on non-expert human input, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry for designing sophisticated AI behaviors.",
