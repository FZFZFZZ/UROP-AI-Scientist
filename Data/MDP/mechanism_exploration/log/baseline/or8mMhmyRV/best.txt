Best idea:
Develop a "Skill Translator" AI that converts natural language descriptions directly into executable skill modules for AI agents in simulation environments. This system would use advanced NLP techniques to parse and understand diverse human-described strategies, then map these descriptions onto a structured skill representation that can be dynamically adjusted as the AI learns and adapts. The Skill Translator would facilitate rapid prototyping and iterative development of AI behaviors based on non-expert human input, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry for designing sophisticated AI behaviors.
