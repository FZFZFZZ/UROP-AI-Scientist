  "target_idea": "Introduce DreamBench++, a human-aligned benchmark automated by advanced multimodal GPT models. This involves designing prompts for GPT to be both human-aligned and self-aligned, with task reinforcement, and constructing a comprehensive dataset of diverse images and prompts.",
  "context": "Personalized image generation is a promising tool for assisting humans in daily tasks due to its ability to creatively generate personalized content. However, current evaluation methods either rely on automated systems that do not align well with human judgment or require human evaluations, which are time-consuming and costly.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive, real-time feedback system for personalized image generation that utilizes wearable biometric sensors to gauge human responses such as heart rate, pupil dilation, and galvanic skin response. This biofeedback can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to determine the emotional and cognitive impact of generated images, effectively tailoring the generation process to elicit desired emotional responses or engagement levels in a user-specific manner. This setup allows for continuous learning and refinement of the generation model based on biofeedback, aligning the generated images more closely with individual preferences and states, thus making the evaluation process both timely and deeply personalized.",
  "final_idea": "Create a benchmark dataset specifically designed for evaluating personalized image generation, which includes a wide range of scenarios and user profiles to test the adaptability and accuracy of different generation models.",
