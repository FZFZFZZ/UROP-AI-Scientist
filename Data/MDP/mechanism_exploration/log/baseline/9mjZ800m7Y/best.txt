Best idea:
Develop a zero-shot learning approach for NAS, where the meta-model is designed to predict Pareto-optimal architectures without any prior direct training on specific hardware configurations or tasks. This approach would rely on learning transferable features across different domains and could dramatically reduce the computational cost of profiling the Pareto front.
