Best idea:
Introduce a hybrid training protocol that combines episodic memory with meta-learning for language models, enabling the model to store specific instances of past learning and apply them when encountering similar tasks. This approach leverages the strengths of both in-context learning and meta-learning, potentially reducing the need for extensive retraining and improving the model's ability to adapt to new tasks using prior knowledge.
