  "target_idea": "Propose ELICIT, a framework with two modules designed to store and reuse task vectors, enhancing the adaptive capabilities of models without additional training or inference tokens.",
  "context": "Enhancing the adaptive capabilities of large language models is a critical pursuit in both research and application. Traditional fine-tuning methods require substantial data, computational resources, and specific capabilities, while in-context learning is limited by the need for appropriate demonstrations and efficient token usage.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning framework for language models in which the model dynamically selects and applies different learning techniques (e.g., fine-tuning, in-context learning, transfer learning) based on the type of query or task it encounters. This approach uses a smaller, specialized decision-making model trained to evaluate the incoming tasks on the fly, assess available resources and data, and optimize learning strategy selection in real time to maximize efficiency and adaptability. This method reduces the resources needed for retraining and enhances the model's responsiveness to diverse tasks without extensive pre-training on each new task type.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a hybrid training protocol that combines episodic memory with meta-learning for language models, enabling the model to store specific instances of past learning and apply them when encountering similar tasks. This approach leverages the strengths of both in-context learning and meta-learning, potentially reducing the need for extensive retraining and improving the model's ability to adapt to new tasks using prior knowledge.",
