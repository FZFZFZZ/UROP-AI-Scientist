  "target_idea": "Introduce propositional probes to extract lexical concepts from token activations and bind them into logical propositions, identifying a binding subspace where bound tokens have high similarity. This method aims to decode faithful representations of input contexts from LMs' internal activations.",
  "context": "Language models (LMs) often exhibit biases, sycophancy, backdoors, and other tendencies that result in unfaithful responses to input contexts. Understanding the internal states of LMs could aid in monitoring and correcting these unfaithful behaviors.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a technique for real-time visualization of activation atlases for specific layers within language models while they are processing input. This visualization will identify patterns and clusters of neuron activations that correlate with biased or unfaithful outputs. By applying anomaly detection algorithms in tandem with these visualizations, we can dynamically adjust model parameters or retrain specific parts of the model when undesirable patterns are detected, ensuring more faithful and unbiased responses.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a hybrid approach combining activation atlases with counterfactual reasoning frameworks to assess and mitigate biases in language models. This method would involve generating counterfactual inputs to visualize how neuron activations differ and using these insights to adjust model responses accordingly.",
