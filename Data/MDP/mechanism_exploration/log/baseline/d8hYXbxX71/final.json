  "target_idea": "Analyze Rawlsian and utilitarian policies within a sequential decision-making framework where individuals' welfare levels decay over time, and policymakers can intervene. Prove that under certain conditions, Rawlsian policies can outperform utilitarian policies in the long run, despite utilitarian policies being more effective in the short term.",
  "context": "Improving social welfare involves optimizing policy objectives across different time horizons, which is challenging because policies that seem suboptimal in the short term may have significant long-term benefits. Rawlsian policies prioritize those with the greatest need, while utilitarian policies focus on maximizing immediate welfare gains. These approaches are traditionally seen as conflicting, with Rawlsian policies thought to reduce average social welfare compared to utilitarian ones.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive AI simulation model that dynamically alternates between Rawlsian and utilitarian policy frameworks based on real-time data analysis of social welfare indicators. This model would use machine learning to predict short-term and long-term outcomes of various policy decisions, automatically adjusting its policy recommendation strategy to optimize both immediate and future welfare. The system could also incorporate feedback loops where policies are continually refined as new data becomes available, ensuring a balanced approach that provides equitable relief when necessary while maximizing overall welfare gains in the long run.",
  "final_idea": "Construct a dynamic programming model to quantitatively compare the long-term effects of Rawlsian and utilitarian policies, incorporating variables such as economic growth, demographic changes, and technological advancements.",
