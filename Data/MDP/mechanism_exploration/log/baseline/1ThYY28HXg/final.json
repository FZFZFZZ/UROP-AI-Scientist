  "target_idea": "Propose a data curation pipeline to extract camera poses and object motion from videos, leading to the creation of a large-scale real-world 4D scene dataset called CamVid-30K. Develop a framework, GenXD, which uses multiview-temporal modules to disentangle camera and object movements, and employs masked latent conditions to support various conditioning views for generating 3D and 4D scenes.",
  "context": "Recent advancements in 2D visual generation have been highly successful, but generating 3D and 4D visuals remains difficult in practical applications. This is primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale 4D data and the lack of effective model designs for these dimensions.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture optimized for sparse 4D data by incorporating temporal coherence regularization. This method would use temporal gradients and smoothness constraints within the adversarial learning framework to enforce realistic time evolution in generated 4D outputs. Such a model could be pre-trained on available 3D datasets augmented with simulated time dimensions before fine-tuning on the scarce 4D data, enhancing its ability to generalize from limited examples.",
  "final_idea": "Create a benchmark dataset for 4D visual generation by synthesizing 4D data from multiple sources, including 3D video captures and temporal 3D scans, to provide a more comprehensive foundation for training and evaluating 4D generative models.",
