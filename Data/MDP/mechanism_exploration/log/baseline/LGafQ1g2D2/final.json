  "target_idea": "Formulate hypotheses about LLMs' capabilities in time series anomaly detection and design experiments to test these hypotheses, focusing on their understanding of time series as images, their reasoning abilities, and performance variations across different models.",
  "context": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become popular in time series forecasting, yet their application in anomaly detection within time series data remains underexplored. There is a need to understand whether LLMs can effectively identify anomalies in time series, especially in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Existing conjectures from time series forecasting research suggest potential capabilities of LLMs in this domain, but these have not been thoroughly investigated.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a method to encode time series data into a natural language-like structure, such as \"sentences\" composed of \"words\" that represent distinct patterns or states in the time series. Train a large language model to understand and generate these structured sequences, then apply the model in a zero-shot learning setup to identify and describe anomalies by leveraging its capability to detect unusual sequences in language. This approach utilizes the intrinsic syntactical analysis strength of LLMs to provide insights into complex time series data, making it possible to detect subtle anomalies that traditional methods might miss.",
  "final_idea": "Design a comparative study to evaluate the effectiveness of different LLM architectures (e.g., Transformer, LSTM) in detecting anomalies in time series, examining their ability to generalize from minimal examples and adapt to diverse anomaly types.",
