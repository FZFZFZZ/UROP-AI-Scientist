  "target_idea": "Develop a biologically constrained model of the mouse barrel cortex with 4,218 neurons across 13 subtypes, using anatomical data to guide neural distribution and connection strengths. Introduce a construction and training pipeline tailored for this model, and convert a simulated whisker sweep dataset into a spiking-based format to train and test the network on biologically realistic neural signals.",
  "context": "The transformation of sensory inputs into motor functions is a fundamental aspect of neuroscience and essential for developing embodied intelligence. Sensory-motor integration involves complex neural circuits and diverse neuronal types, posing a challenge in bridging biological realism with behavioral functionality. The columnar structure of the superficial layers of the mouse barrel cortex serves as a model system for studying these processes.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid computational model that integrates real-time data from optical imaging of the mouse barrel cortex during sensory stimulation with machine learning algorithms that simulate motor output. This model would use reinforcement learning to dynamically predict and improve motor responses based on sensory input patterns, effectively learning optimal sensory-motor integration pathways analogous to biological processes. The system could be tested by applying it to control a robotic limb that mimics mouse whisker movements, providing insights into both the neuroscience of sensory processing and the development of more biologically realistic robotic systems.",
  "final_idea": "Utilize advanced imaging and electrophysiological data from the mouse barrel cortex to refine the spiking neural network model, ensuring that it accurately represents the diverse types of neurons and their connections. This data-driven approach could improve the model's predictive power and biological fidelity.",
