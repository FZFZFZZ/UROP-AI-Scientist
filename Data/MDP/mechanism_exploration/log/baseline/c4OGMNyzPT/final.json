  "target_idea": "Propose LVLM-Playground, a game-based evaluation framework that comprehensively assesses LVLMs' cognitive and reasoning skills in structured environments. This framework evaluates LVLMs on four core tasks: Perceiving, Question Answering, Rule Following, and End-to-End Playing, each designed to test specific abilities like visual perception, reasoning, and decision-making.",
  "context": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in processing both visual and textual information. However, current evaluation methods, such as those based on Visual Question Answering and image captioning benchmarks, are insufficient in fully capturing the capabilities of LVLMs. These methods are limited by inadequate assessment of detailed visual perception, data contamination, and a lack of emphasis on multi-turn reasoning.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an evaluation framework that uses interactive storytelling with visual elements where a model is provided a series of connected, evolving scenes (images or videos) and must generate, update, and refine a coherent narrative over multiple interactions. The model's performance is assessed based on its ability to handle complex narrative shifts, include detailed visual subtext in the story, and maintain logical consistency across turns. This method focuses not only on the model's synthesis of the visual and textual domains but also on its multi-turn reasoning and depth of visual understanding.",
  "final_idea": "Formulate a simulation-based assessment where LVLMs interact with a virtual environment, responding to changes and making decisions based on both visual cues and textual instructions, measuring their adaptability and decision-making skills.",
