  "target_idea": "Propose a method called Parameter Learning Attack (PLA) to track the copyright of LVLMs without altering the original model. This involves creating adversarial images that prompt specific outputs from the model, allowing it to learn trigger images by updating parameters in the opposite direction during adversarial attacks, ensuring effectiveness on fine-tuned models for copyright tracking.",
  "context": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in image understanding and dialogue, making them suitable for various visual question answering tasks. However, their availability has led to concerns about unauthorized use and copyright infringement, as individuals can fine-tune published models to create their own LVLMs.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a blockchain-based authentication mechanism for LVLMs where each model's output is encoded with a unique cryptographic signature that verifies its authenticity and original source. As users interact with or fine-tune these models, their interactions and modifications also generate unique, traceable signatures, enabling robust tracking and regulation of model usage and lineage. This system would make unauthorized use and model plagiarism easily detectable and prosecutable, fostering a transparent ecosystem for sharing and developing LVLMs.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a model 'fingerprinting' technique that embeds a distinct, non-removable signature in the model's architecture, which can be revealed and verified through a specific set of input-output tests. This fingerprint would persist through iterations of fine-tuning, ensuring traceability.",
