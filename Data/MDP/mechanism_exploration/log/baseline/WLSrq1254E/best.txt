Best idea:
Develop a framework for modular meta-training of LLMs where the base model is trained on a broad corpus and additional, smaller "overlay" modules are trained for specific domains or preferences. These overlay modules can be dynamically attached or detached from the base model depending on the user's current needs, allowing for flexible adaptation to multiple scenarios without the computational and data overhead of retraining the entire model. This approach would use reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the selection and blending of these modules in real-time based on user feedback.
