  "target_idea": "Implement online reinforcement learning using Lean's verification outcomes as a reward signal to refine proof completion policies. Additionally, introduce RMaxTS, a Monte-Carlo tree search variant with an intrinsic-reward-driven exploration strategy to generate diverse proof paths, addressing the sparse-reward problem in proof search.",
  "context": "Lean is a sophisticated proof assistant that aids in formal theorem proving by offering interactive feedback. The challenge lies in enhancing large language models to construct formal proofs effectively, aligning them with formal verification systems.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid AI system that integrates Lean's formal language for theorem proving with a large language model trained specifically on mathematical texts and proofs. This system will utilize dual learning pathways: the language model generates potential proof steps and narratives, while Lean evaluates and fine-tunes these steps for mathematical rigour and correctness. Additionally, the system will iteratively improve by using the feedback from Lean's verifications to refine the language model's understanding and generation of complex mathematical proofs.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm where the language model is rewarded for each successful proof step validated by Lean, encouraging the model to explore and optimize proof strategies dynamically. This could involve complex reward structures that account for the elegance and simplicity of the proofs.",
