  "target_idea": "Propose an end-to-end deep learning-based multi-view clustering framework applicable to general data types, utilizing a novel permutation-based canonical correlation objective to generate fused representations. Cluster assignments are determined by identifying consistent pseudo-labels across multiple views, with a theoretical analysis provided to show the approximation to supervised linear discriminant analysis (LDA).",
  "context": "Combining data from different sources can enhance data analysis tasks like clustering. However, existing multi-view clustering methods are often domain-specific or rely on a suboptimal, computationally intensive two-stage process involving separate representation learning and clustering.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a unified multi-view clustering framework using a graph-based representation where different data sources are treated as distinct graph layers. Utilize a cross-layer attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the influence of each data source based on its relevance to the clustering task at hand, enhancing data integration and cluster formation. This approach leverages the natural connectivity patterns across heterogeneous data sources, facilitating real-time clustering adjustments and scalability to large datasets without the need for separate representation learning stages.",
  "final_idea": "Propose a multi-view clustering framework that employs a modular neural network architecture, where each module specializes in processing data from a specific source. These modules then interact through a shared latent space that aligns and integrates the data, optimizing clustering by leveraging the strengths of each data type effectively.",
