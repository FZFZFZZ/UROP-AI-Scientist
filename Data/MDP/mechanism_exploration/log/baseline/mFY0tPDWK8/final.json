  "target_idea": "Introduce the Apollo-MILP framework, which alternates between prediction and correction steps to improve solution accuracy. It uses a trust-region search to refine solutions and incorporates an Uncertainty-based Error upper BOund (UEBO) to evaluate prediction uncertainty, fixing only those values with high confidence.",
  "context": "In recent years, machine learning has been increasingly used to predict initial solutions for mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems. These methods typically involve predicting a solution and fixing a subset of variables to reduce the problem's dimensionality before solving the reduced problem to obtain final solutions. However, directly fixing variable values based on predictions can result in low-quality solutions or infeasible problems if the predictions are inaccurate.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a reinforcement learning-based approach where an agent continually adjusts the fixed variables in a MILP problem based on feedback from the solution's quality and feasibility. The agent uses a policy gradient method to learn the optimum set of variables to fix and their values, guided by rewards determined by solution feasibility and closeness to optimality. This adaptive fixing approach allows the agent to dynamically change its strategy based on the solving environment, potentially leading to better and more reliable solutions even with initial inaccurate predictions.",
  "final_idea": "Integrate a Bayesian optimization framework to dynamically adjust the fixed variables in MILP, using a probabilistic model to estimate the uncertainty in variable predictions. This approach allows for an adaptive decision-making process, where the degree of variable fixing is modulated based on the confidence in prediction accuracy, thereby potentially enhancing the quality of the solutions.",
