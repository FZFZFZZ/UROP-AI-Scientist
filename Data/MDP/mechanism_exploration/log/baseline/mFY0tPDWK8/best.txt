Best idea:
Integrate a Bayesian optimization framework to dynamically adjust the fixed variables in MILP, using a probabilistic model to estimate the uncertainty in variable predictions. This approach allows for an adaptive decision-making process, where the degree of variable fixing is modulated based on the confidence in prediction accuracy, thereby potentially enhancing the quality of the solutions.
