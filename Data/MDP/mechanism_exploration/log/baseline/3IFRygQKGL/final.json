  "target_idea": "Introduce OptionZero, a novel approach that integrates an option network into MuZero, enabling the autonomous discovery of options through self-play games. Additionally, modify the dynamics network to provide environment transitions when using options, allowing for deeper search under the same simulation constraints.",
  "context": "In reinforcement learning, planning with options, which are sequences of primitive actions, has proven effective in complex environments. Previous research has primarily focused on using predefined options or options learned from expert demonstration data. However, there is a need for methods that can autonomously discover and utilize options without relying on human knowledge.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a reinforcement learning framework incorporating a generative adversarial network (GAN) specifically designed for option discovery in complex environments. The generator creates potential options, and the discriminator evaluates these options based on their efficiency and efficacy in achieving specific subgoals within the environment. This adversarial process iterates autonomously, refining the set of options dynamically as the agent explores and learns from the environment, thus eliminating the need for predefined options or expert-generated data.",
