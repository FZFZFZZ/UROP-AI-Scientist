Best idea:
Develop a reinforcement learning framework incorporating a generative adversarial network (GAN) specifically designed for option discovery in complex environments. The generator creates potential options, and the discriminator evaluates these options based on their efficiency and efficacy in achieving specific subgoals within the environment. This adversarial process iterates autonomously, refining the set of options dynamically as the agent explores and learns from the environment, thus eliminating the need for predefined options or expert-generated data.
