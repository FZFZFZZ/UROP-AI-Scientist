  "target_idea": "Propose a communication-efficient pre-training framework called DEPT, which separates embeddings from the transformer body and allows simultaneous training on multiple data sources without a shared vocabulary. This method reduces token embedding parameters to match the data source vocabulary, cuts communication costs, and enhances the transformer's adaptability and generalization.",
  "context": "Language model pre-training typically involves using diverse data mixtures to improve performance across various domains and languages. However, this process is resource-intensive and costly due to the significant differences in lexical, syntactic, and semantic aspects of the data sources, which can lead to negative interference known as the 'curse of multilinguality'.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic data filtering method for language model pre-training that leverages real-time performance feedback. The system would analyze the model's incremental learning trajectories and adjust the training corpus composition based on emerging strengths and weaknesses, focusing on balancing domain-specific proficiency and generalization capabilities. This adaptivity would minimize resource waste by tailoring the linguistic diversity of the training data to optimally counteract the curse of multilinguality, thus making pre-training more cost-effective and efficient.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a modular training approach where different language modules are trained separately and then integrated into a central framework using transfer learning techniques to reduce negative interference and improve computational efficiency.",
