  "target_idea": "Utilize an LLM as a policy to generate lines of code, joining these lines to implicitly estimate their value in subsequent iterations. Enhance this process by executing each line and annotating it with results, allowing the model to search for programs within a single expanding prompt by reasoning in both syntactic and semantic spaces.",
  "context": "Large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating code from examples without being restricted to a domain-specific language (DSL). However, these models lack a search mechanism, as the generated programs are independent and do not consider the value of each line of code in subsequent iterations.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning framework for large language models that dynamically evaluates and prioritizes code snippets based on their impact on subsequent iterations of code generation. This framework would incorporate a feedback loop where each snippet's effectiveness is assessed by running test cases and performance metrics in a simulated or virtual environment. Over time, the model learns to predict the utility of code snippets for solving specific types of problems, enhancing its efficiency and accuracy in generating functional programs.",
  "final_idea": "Create a feedback loop between the LLM and a runtime environment, where the model not only generates code but also actively monitors its execution and adjusts subsequent code generation based on runtime errors and performance issues.",
