Best idea:
Develop an adaptive regularization mechanism during the classifier re-training phase that hinges on the quality and diversity of features learned during the initial representation learning stage. This mechanism would dynamically adjust regularization strength based on real-time feedback about feature discriminability and representation sparsity for different classes. This approach can help effectively utilize learned representations, particularly for minority classes in long-tailed distributions, thus potentially improving the robustness and generalization of the model across varying class frequencies.
