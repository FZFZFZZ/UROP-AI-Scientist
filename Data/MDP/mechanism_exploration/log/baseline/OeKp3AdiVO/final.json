  "target_idea": "Introduce two new metrics, Logits Magnitude and Regularized Standard Deviation, to assess classifier re-training methods. Develop a label over-smoothing approach that adjusts logits by softening one-hot labels, improving model performance without needing prior class distribution knowledge.",
  "context": "In long-tailed recognition, the Decoupled Training paradigm has been effective by separating training into representation learning and classifier re-training. Previous efforts to enhance both stages simultaneously have made it difficult to isolate the impact of classifier re-training. Recent findings suggest that simple regularization can yield strong feature representations, prompting a reevaluation of classifier re-training methods.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive regularization mechanism during the classifier re-training phase that hinges on the quality and diversity of features learned during the initial representation learning stage. This mechanism would dynamically adjust regularization strength based on real-time feedback about feature discriminability and representation sparsity for different classes. This approach can help effectively utilize learned representations, particularly for minority classes in long-tailed distributions, thus potentially improving the robustness and generalization of the model across varying class frequencies.",
