  "target_idea": "Propose a novel evaluation framework and introduce JudgeBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based judges on challenging tasks across knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench uses a new pipeline to convert difficult datasets into response pairs with preference labels that reflect objective correctness.",
  "context": "LLM-based judges are increasingly used as scalable alternatives to human evaluation for assessing and improving models. However, their reliability is often not thoroughly examined, especially as LLMs become more sophisticated. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on alignment with human preferences, which may not be suitable for tasks requiring factual and logical correctness.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-benchmarking system that employs a dual-evaluation framework, where outputs from LLM-based judges and human judges are independently evaluated by a third, highly curated panel of expert systems and humans specialized in various fields (law, science, etc.). This panel reviews decisions on a range of criteria including factual accuracy, logical consistency, and ethical soundness. The system uses discrepancies between the LLM and human evaluations to automatically adjust LLM training parameters, improving their judgment capabilities and reliability over time.",
  "final_idea": "Create a certification process for LLM-based judges that includes rigorous testing against a standardized set of benchmarks focused on factual correctness and logical reasoning before deployment.",
