Best idea:
Enhance the robustness of the noise model by integrating sensor-specific calibration data into the training process. By using real calibration data from EMCCDs, the GAN can better learn the device-specific noise characteristics, potentially improving the generalizability and accuracy of the denoising across different EMCCD models used in various scientific fields.
