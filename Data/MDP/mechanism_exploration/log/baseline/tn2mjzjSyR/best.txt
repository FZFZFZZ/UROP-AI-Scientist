Best idea:
Develop a dynamic reasoning framework for LLMs that employs a meta-cognitive layer to optimize reasoning strategies based on the unique nature of each query. This layer uses real-time performance feedback, query complexity analysis, and historical interaction data to select or generate the most effective reasoning sequence — such as analogical reasoning, causal reasoning, or stepwise logical deduction — specifically tailored to the context and difficulty of the question. This approach ensures that the reasoning mechanism adapts and evolves, improving both the efficiency and quality of responses over time.
