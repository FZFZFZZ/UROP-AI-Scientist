  "target_idea": "Introduce DOTS, a method that enables LLMs to reason dynamically by searching for optimal reasoning trajectories tailored to each question's characteristics and the LLM's capabilities. This involves defining atomic reasoning action modules, searching for optimal action trajectories through iterative exploration, and training an LLM to plan reasoning trajectories for new questions using two learning paradigms: fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM.",
  "context": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have focused on improving their reasoning capabilities. Previous methods have utilized various prompting strategies to aid reasoning, such as step-by-step thinking and program-based solutions. However, these strategies often apply static reasoning actions uniformly across all questions, without adapting to the specific characteristics of each question or the capabilities of the LLM.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic reasoning framework for LLMs that employs a meta-cognitive layer to optimize reasoning strategies based on the unique nature of each query. This layer uses real-time performance feedback, query complexity analysis, and historical interaction data to select or generate the most effective reasoning sequence — such as analogical reasoning, causal reasoning, or stepwise logical deduction — specifically tailored to the context and difficulty of the question. This approach ensures that the reasoning mechanism adapts and evolves, improving both the efficiency and quality of responses over time.",
