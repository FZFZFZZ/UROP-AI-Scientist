Explore the integration of topological data analysis tools, such as persistent homology, to provide new insights into the multi-scale structure of graphs within the hierarchical diffusion model. This approach could uncover new types of graph invariants useful for more complex tasks like molecular structure analysis or complex systems simulation.
