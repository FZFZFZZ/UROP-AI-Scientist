  "target_idea": "Introduce a computationally efficient topological summary called zigzag spaghetti (ZS) that extracts latent salient topological graph descriptors at different resolutions using zigzag persistence. This approach integrates dynamic topological information into graph diffusion models, providing theoretical stability guarantees and enhancing model performance and robustness.",
  "context": "Diffusion models have recently gained attention as a powerful tool for generative artificial intelligence on graphs, with applications in areas such as drug design and knowledge discovery. Despite their potential, current graph diffusion models struggle to comprehensively capture the intrinsic higher-order topological properties of graphs, which limits their generalizability and effectiveness for various tasks.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hierarchical diffusion model framework for graphs that incorporates multi-scale topological features and enhances the modelâ€™s capacity to recognize and generate complex topologies. This framework would use a layered approach, where each layer captures different scales of topology (e.g., node-level, community-level, and graph-level features) and integrates them using a multi-resolution graph convolution technique. This method could improve the generalizability and fidelity of graph diffusion models in applications like protein folding prediction or complex network synthesis, adapting dynamically to the level of granularity required by specific tasks.",
  "final_idea": "Explore the integration of topological data analysis tools, such as persistent homology, to provide new insights into the multi-scale structure of graphs within the hierarchical diffusion model. This approach could uncover new types of graph invariants useful for more complex tasks like molecular structure analysis or complex systems simulation.",
