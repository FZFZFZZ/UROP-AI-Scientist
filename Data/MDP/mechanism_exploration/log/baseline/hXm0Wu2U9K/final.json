  "target_idea": "Introduce a new algorithm called $χ^2$-Preference Optimization ($χ$PO), which modifies the logarithmic link function in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This change incorporates regularization with the $χ^2$-divergence, effectively implementing the principle of pessimism in the face of uncertainty, and provides sample-complexity guarantees based on single-policy concentrability, making it robust to overoptimization.",
  "context": "Language model alignment methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), have significantly improved language model capabilities. However, these methods face a challenge known as overoptimization, where the model's quality deteriorates during the alignment process due to overfitting to inaccuracies in the offline reward model. Existing methods use KL-regularization to mitigate this issue, but it remains insufficient to prevent performance degradation.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic regularization strategy that adjusts the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty based on real-time detection of semantic drift using linguistic style embeddings. Integrate a dual-feedback loop system where one loop monitors changes in language model embeddings over time, identifying shifts from baseline embeddings pre-optimization, while the second loop dynamically scales the KL divergence penalty to counteract detected shifts. This approach would maintain alignment performance while preventing overoptimization by adapting the regularization strength in response to emerging overfitting or semantic discrepancies.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a hybrid alignment algorithm that integrates Jensen-Shannon divergence with a dynamic weighting system, where weights are adjusted based on the variance of model predictions to ensure robustness against overfitting and maintain alignment fidelity throughout training.",
