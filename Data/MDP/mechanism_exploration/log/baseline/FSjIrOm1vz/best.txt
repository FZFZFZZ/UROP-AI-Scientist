Best idea:
Develop a dynamic context modulation mechanism for LLMs that adjusts the amount of context used based on the computational complexity and the relevance of the task at hand. This mechanism employs an adaptive indexing system that prioritizes key sections of the context while temporarily suppressing less relevant details, varying the 'depth' and 'breadth' of context in real-time as the model processes inputs. This would not only optimize computational resources but also enhance the modelâ€™s performance by focusing on the most pertinent information for decision making.
