  "target_idea": "Propose LongAlign, which includes a segment-level encoding method for processing long texts and a decomposed preference optimization method for effective alignment training. This involves dividing long texts into segments for separate processing and using decomposed CLIP-based preference models to fine-tune diffusion models, with a reweighting strategy to reduce overfitting and enhance alignment.",
  "context": "The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has enabled them to generate unprecedented results from given texts. However, as text inputs become longer, existing encoding methods like CLIP face limitations, and aligning the generated images with long texts becomes challenging.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hierarchical text-to-image diffusion model that processes long text inputs in a structured, multi-layer approach. First, the model would use an initial layer to summarize and extract key themes and visual descriptors from the text. Subsequent layers would then focus on generating coherent and detailed visual representations based on the summarized output, allowing for better alignment and detailed image generation from complex, lengthy narratives.",
  "final_idea": "Enhance the model's architecture by introducing a hierarchical attention mechanism that processes text at multiple levels of granularity, from phrases to full paragraphs, ensuring that each segment's visual representation aligns accurately with its semantic content.",
