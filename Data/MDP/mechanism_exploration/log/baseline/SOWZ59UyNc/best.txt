Best idea:
Design a theorem proving system equipped with a mechanism to simulate informal human reasoning through a virtual mathematician agent. This agent would generate hypotheses and reasoning paths based on a database of informal mathematical discussions and integrate these with formal proof steps to enhance the solution's creativity and intuitiveness.
