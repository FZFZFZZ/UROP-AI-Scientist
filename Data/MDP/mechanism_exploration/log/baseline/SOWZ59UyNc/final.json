  "target_idea": "Introduce Lean-STaR, a framework that trains language models to generate informal thoughts before each proof step, enhancing theorem-proving capabilities. It uses retrospective ground-truth tactics to create synthetic thoughts for training and applies expert iteration to refine the model using correct proofs verified by the Lean solver.",
  "context": "Traditional language model-based theorem proving relies on training models with formal proof data, assuming that this will enable them to learn theorem proving. However, this approach overlooks the informal thought processes that humans use when constructing proofs, which are not captured in formal proofs.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid theorem proving model that integrates natural language processing with formal proof mechanisms by using dual-training pathways. One pathway trains on traditional formal proofs as usual, while the second pathway learns from annotated narratives of mathematicians' thought processes, discussions, and heuristic approaches to solving problems, captured through interviews or expert writings. This model would then use a dynamic blending algorithm to integrate insights from both formal logic and informal reasoning, allowing it to generate and evaluate proofs in a way that mimics human-like flexibility and creativity in problem-solving.",
  "final_idea": "Design a theorem proving system equipped with a mechanism to simulate informal human reasoning through a virtual mathematician agent. This agent would generate hypotheses and reasoning paths based on a database of informal mathematical discussions and integrate these with formal proof steps to enhance the solution's creativity and intuitiveness.",
