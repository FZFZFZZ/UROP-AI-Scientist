  "target_idea": "Propose the adaptation of efficient influence function-based data attribution methods to the RLHF setting to better understand the impact of fine-tuning data on trustworthiness benchmarks, demonstrating feasibility through estimated attribution scores.",
  "context": "The trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical factor that encompasses the reliability, safety, and ethical alignment of their outputs. Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) is commonly used to align LLMs with human preferences, but its impact on trustworthiness has not been thoroughly evaluated. This study examines the performance of models aligned with general-purpose preference data across five trustworthiness dimensions: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy.",
  "initial_idea": "Implement an adaptive feedback mechanism where the model dynamically updates its behavior based on real-time assessment of trustworthiness metrics while interacting with users. This mechanism would use a combination of user feedback and automated monitoring of trustworthiness criteria (like toxicity, bias, etc.) to adjust the model's responses in real-time. Furthermore, integration of this system with continual learning strategies would enable the model to evolve its understanding and application of ethical guidelines and truthfulness, enhancing long-term reliability and safety.",
  "final_idea": "Integrate a counterfactual analysis module within the RLHF system to simulate and compare outcomes with and without specific human feedback, thus identifying the direct effects of feedback on trustworthiness dimensions like ethics and truthfulness.",
