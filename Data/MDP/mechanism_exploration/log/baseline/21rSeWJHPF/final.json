  "target_idea": "Introduce a new approach called 'relative centrality' for unsupervised ranking on graphs, which involves an iterative graph-dependent local normalization of centrality scores to promote balancedness while maintaining ranking validity.",
  "context": "Ranking vertices in a graph is a fundamental task in computer science, often using centrality measures like PageRank. Traditional ranking algorithms can produce unbalanced rankings, especially in graphs with underlying communities, leading to information loss, polarized opinions, and reduced diversity.",
  "initial_idea": "Introduce a \"Community-Aware PageRank\" (CAP) algorithm that integrates community detection with traditional PageRank logic to better handle graphs with pronounced community structures. CAP would adjust the transition probabilities in the PageRank algorithm based on the community membership of nodes, possibly increasing the transition probabilities within the same community and reducing them between different communities. This adaptation would aim to balance the influence across communities, thereby preserving local context and maintaining overall diversity in the vertex ranking.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a regularization term in the ranking algorithm that penalizes large differences in centrality scores among nodes within the same community, aiming to preserve community structure while maintaining overall ranking integrity.",
