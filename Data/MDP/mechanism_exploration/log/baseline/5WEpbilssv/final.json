  "target_idea": "Propose PerturbQA, a benchmark designed for structured reasoning over perturbation experiments, focusing on predicting differential expression and gene set enrichment for unseen perturbations. Introduce Summer, a domain-informed LLM framework that effectively addresses these challenges.",
  "context": "High-content perturbation experiments offer detailed insights into biomolecular systems but are hindered by high costs and complex analysis. Current machine learning approaches fail to capture the semantic depth of biological data and are not well-aligned with biological analysis goals.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid AI system that combines graph neural networks (GNN) with generative adversarial networks (GAN) specifically tailored for high-content perturbation experiments. The GNN would model the complex interactions between various biological molecules and pathways, effectively capturing the semantic depth of biological data. Concurrently, the GAN component would generate synthetic biological data that reinforce rare or underrepresented perturbation effects, thereby reducing experimental costs and enhancing the scale of data for better training and predictive accuracy in biological analysis.",
  "final_idea": "Propose a new evaluation metric for machine learning models that specifically measures their ability to decode and predict outcomes from biological perturbation experiments, ensuring that the models contribute meaningfully to biological insights.",
