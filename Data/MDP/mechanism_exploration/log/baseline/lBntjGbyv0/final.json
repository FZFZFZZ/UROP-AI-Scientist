  "target_idea": "Introduce BitStack, a novel, training-free weight compression method that allows for flexible memory usage and model performance trade-offs. BitStack uses weight decomposition to dynamically adjust model size with minimal data transfer between memory and storage, iteratively decomposing weight matrices and stacking residual blocks as basic transmission units based on available memory.",
  "context": "Large language models have significantly advanced various applications, but their deployment is hindered by memory limitations on local devices. The focus has shifted from enhancing capabilities to improving availability, highlighting the need for efficient memory management. Traditional compression methods, such as quantization, often require fixed compression ratios and separate processes for each setting, complicating deployment in environments with varying memory constraints.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive compression framework for large language models that utilizes real-time monitoring of system memory usage and computational load to dynamically adjust the compression ratio and model parameters. This system could employ machine learning to predict optimal compression settings based on current device performance metrics and environmental factors. This approach would allow the seamless deployment of language models on devices with fluctuating memory availability, maximizing efficiency without significant degradation in performance.",
  "final_idea": "Develop an adaptive compression framework using tensor train decomposition for language models, which dynamically adjusts the rank based on real-time memory availability and computational constraints, ensuring optimal performance across devices.",
