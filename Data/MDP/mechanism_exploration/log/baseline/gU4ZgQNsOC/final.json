  "target_idea": "Introduce novel algorithms for dynamic, instance-level data reweighting that adjust the weight of each training sample based on its loss value in real-time. This approach allows the model to focus on more informative samples during training and deprioritize redundant data, supported by a new theoretical framework analyzing the impact of loss-based reweighting on optimization convergence.",
  "context": "Pretraining large language models on extensive and varied datasets is essential for achieving top performance in various tasks. However, current training methods treat all data samples equally, ignoring the individual importance or relevance of each sample during training. Existing strategies that reweight data focus on group-level importance and fail to utilize detailed instance-level information, lacking adaptability to the changing importance of samples as training progresses.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive instance-level reweighting mechanism for large language model pretraining by using a meta-learning approach. This method would involve training a secondary model to predict the importance of each data sample based on its impact on validation performance during various stages of training. The primary model's training process would then dynamically adjust the weight of each sample based on these predictions, optimizing learning efficiency and effectiveness by prioritizing more informative or challenging examples as the model evolves.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a meta-learning algorithm that adjusts sample weights based on their impact on model validation loss, allowing the model to prioritize learning from instances that most improve generalization. This approach would continuously update the importance of each data sample throughout the training process.",
