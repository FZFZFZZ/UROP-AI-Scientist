  "target_idea": "Propose a novel training strategy for SSMDE using triplet mining to identify reflective regions at the pixel level, guided by camera geometry between different viewpoints. Introduce a reflection-aware triplet mining loss to penalize inappropriate photometric error minimization on reflective regions while maintaining depth accuracy on non-reflective areas, and incorporate a reflection-aware knowledge distillation method for selective pixel-level learning.",
  "context": "Self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SSMDE) aims to predict dense depth maps from monocular images without requiring ground-truth depth labels, by learning from RGB image sequences. This approach simplifies data acquisition compared to supervised methods but faces challenges with reflective surfaces, which violate Lambertian reflectance assumptions, leading to inaccurate training on such surfaces.",
  "initial_idea": "Introduce an auxiliary network designed to specifically address the challenges posed by reflective surfaces in SSMDE. This network could be trained using a combination of synthetic data (where accurate control of reflectance properties is possible) and real-world images labeled by experts for levels of reflectivity. It would operate parallel to the main depth estimation model, identifying reflective regions in the input images and adjusting the depth inference process based on the properties of reflective surfaces, effectively teaching the main model how to handle different types of reflections dynamically.",
  "final_idea": "Apply a multi-task learning framework where the SSMDE model not only predicts depth but also classifies regions of the image according to their reflectivity, using this classification to guide the depth estimation process more accurately.",
