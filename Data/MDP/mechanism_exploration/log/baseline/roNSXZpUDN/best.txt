Develop a "Domain-Adaptive Conversation Simulator" (DACS) that creates interactive and dynamic environments tailored to specific industries like retail or airlines. DACS would utilize high-fidelity simulations integrating real-world data from these domains to train language agents. It can dynamically alter scenarios or inject domain-specific challenges and regulations to ensure that agents not only learn to converse effectively but also strictly adhere to industry-specific guidelines and practices.
