  "target_idea": "Introduce Ï„-bench, a benchmark designed to simulate dynamic conversations in retail and airline domains, using language models to emulate users and providing agents with domain-specific API tools and policy guidelines. Implement an evaluation process that compares the database state post-conversation with the annotated goal state, and propose a new metric, pass^k, to assess agent reliability over multiple trials.",
  "context": "Current benchmarks for language agents are inadequate for ensuring interaction with human users or adherence to domain-specific rules, which are crucial for safe and realistic deployment. These benchmarks fail to simulate dynamic conversations in specific domains, such as retail and airline, where agents must follow guidelines and use domain-specific tools.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a \"Domain-Adaptive Conversation Simulator\" (DACS) that creates interactive and dynamic environments tailored to specific industries like retail or airlines. DACS would utilize high-fidelity simulations integrating real-world data from these domains to train language agents. It can dynamically alter scenarios or inject domain-specific challenges and regulations to ensure that agents not only learn to converse effectively but also strictly adhere to industry-specific guidelines and practices.",
