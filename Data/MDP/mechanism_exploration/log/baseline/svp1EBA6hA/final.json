  "target_idea": "Introduce a novel method called CTRL, which uses reinforcement learning to add controls to pre-trained diffusion models. This method formulates the task as an RL problem, using an offline dataset for learning a classifier and employing KL divergence against pre-trained models as reward functions, enabling sampling from the conditional distribution with additional controls during inference.",
  "context": "Diffusion models are advanced generative models that enable precise control over generated samples. Despite their success when trained on large datasets, there is a need for additional controls during downstream fine-tuning processes, treating these models as pre-trained diffusion models.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning framework for diffusion models where the model iteratively adapains its fine-tuning process based on feedback from its generated samples. In this approach, the model not only uses a large pre-trained dataset but also incorporates a real-time feedback mechanism where each generated sample's quality and fidelity are evaluated according to user-defined criteria. This feedback is used to dynamically adjust the model’s parameters or training strategy, enhancing the model’s ability to produce highly tailored and contextually appropriate outputs without extensive retraining.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach for fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models, where the reward function is designed to optimize the quality and specificity of generated samples. This method would use a policy gradient to adjust the model parameters incrementally, focusing on maximizing user satisfaction with the generated outputs.",
