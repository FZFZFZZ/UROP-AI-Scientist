Best idea:
Introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach for fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models, where the reward function is designed to optimize the quality and specificity of generated samples. This method would use a policy gradient to adjust the model parameters incrementally, focusing on maximizing user satisfaction with the generated outputs.
