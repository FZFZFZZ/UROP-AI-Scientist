  "target_idea": "Introduce MANTRA, a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for benchmarking higher-order models, consisting of over 43,000 and 250,000 triangulations of surfaces and three-dimensional manifolds, respectively, to facilitate the evaluation and development of topological methods in TDL.",
  "context": "The field of topological deep learning (TDL) is focused on designing neural networks that can leverage higher-order interactions in complex systems, particularly using higher-order domains like simplicial complexes. However, the advancement of this field is limited by the lack of datasets suitable for benchmarking these higher-order models.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a large-scale generative model that automatically synthesizes realistic and complex datasets containing higher-order interactions by mimicking the underlying structures of naturally occurring complex systems, such as biological ecosystems or social networks. This model could use variations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) tailored to produce simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, adjusted through feedback from domain experts in biology, sociology, and physics to ensure the generated datasets are both challenging and representative. The generated datasets can then be used as benchmarks to evaluate and refine models in topological deep learning, fostering progress by providing a diverse array of test cases simulating real-world complexity.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a synthetic dataset generator for TDL, utilizing algorithms that can dynamically create complex topologies mimicking real-world data, accompanied by a set of tools for analyzing the intrinsic topological properties of generated datasets.",
