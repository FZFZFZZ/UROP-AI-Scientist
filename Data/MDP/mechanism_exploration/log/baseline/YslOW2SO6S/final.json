  "target_idea": "Propose the Circular Transformer (CirT), a geometric-inspired model that addresses the cyclic nature of the graticule by decomposing weather data into circular patches by latitude as input tokens and using Fourier transform in self-attention to capture global information and spatial periodicity.",
  "context": "Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) climate forecasting is crucial for applications like agriculture planning and disaster preparedness but remains challenging due to its chaotic nature. Recent data-driven models have shown potential but are limited by their inadequate handling of geometric inductive biases, often treating spherical weather data as planar images, which leads to inaccurate spatial representations.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a data-driven S2S climate forecasting model that integrates differential geometry for more accurate handling of spherical data. The model will employ Riemannian Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) specifically adapted to process data defined on spherical surfaces, ensuring that distances and angles are preserved in the training processes. This approach could enhance the model's capability to capture complex spatial patterns and interactions on Earth's surface, potentially leading to more precise and reliable forecasts.",
  "final_idea": "Explore the use of Fourier Transform Convolutional Neural Networks (FT-CNNs) for S2S climate forecasting, which can natively handle spherical data by operating in the spectral domain. This method would directly tackle the spherical harmonics, capturing global atmospheric patterns more effectively and accurately.",
