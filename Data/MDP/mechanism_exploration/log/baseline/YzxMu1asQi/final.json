  "target_idea": "Investigate adversarial attacks on language model activations to derive scaling laws for attack susceptibility, demonstrating that controlling a small subset of activations can predict a large number of subsequent tokens. This approach provides insights into the dimensionality theory of adversarial attacks and highlights the potential for stronger attacks compared to those targeting input tokens.",
  "context": "Adversarial attacks on language models can manipulate model predictions by targeting activations rather than input tokens. These attacks reveal a scaling law where the number of tokens an attacker can control is linearly related to the number of activations manipulated. The stability of attack resistance across different model sizes and families suggests a dimensionality mismatch between input and output spaces as a potential cause of these vulnerabilities.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a method to dynamically adjust the dimensionality of a language model's internal representations based on the characteristics of incoming input sequences, thereby reducing the susceptibility to adversarial attacks that manipulate activations. This technique would involve using a meta-learning approach to detect unusual patterns in activation spaces and responsively modulate the network's internal representation dimensions. By adding this adaptive layer, the model could potentially prevent adversarial alignments of activations by continuously reshaping its internal predictive landscape in response to detected threats.",
