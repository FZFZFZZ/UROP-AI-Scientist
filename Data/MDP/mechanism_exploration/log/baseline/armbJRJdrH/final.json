  "target_idea": "Reformulate the generative modeling task along diffusion trajectories in pixel space as a discriminative task in latent space using instance discrimination to align temporally adjacent points. This approach enables implicit denoising-then-classification via a single prediction, significantly reducing inference costs.",
  "context": "Robustness is crucial for deep neural networks, particularly in security-sensitive applications. Randomized smoothing offers theoretical guarantees for certifying robustness against adversarial perturbations. Diffusion models have been used for randomized smoothing to purify noise-perturbed samples before classification, but they face challenges with larger perturbations and high computational costs during inference.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid architecture combining diffusion models with lightweight generative adversarial networks (GANs) for enhanced randomized smoothing. The GANs can first swiftly approximate the denoising function for larger perturbations, acting as a pre-processing step, while the diffusion models fine-tune the output to ensure maximum fidelity and robustness. This approach aims to reduce the computational burden during inference and extend the robustness of the system against a wider range of adversarial attacks with varying intensities.",
  "final_idea": "Research the potential of progressive growing of diffusion models, where models are trained incrementally on increasing levels of noise complexity, to systematically build robustness and reduce the inference time required for effective randomized smoothing.",
