Best idea:
Create a GNN architecture that incorporates a spectral clustering-based regularization technique to enforce sparsity in the connectivity matrix, thereby reducing the effective depth and breadth of the network. This method would prioritize the most informative connections during the forward pass, optimizing computational resources.
