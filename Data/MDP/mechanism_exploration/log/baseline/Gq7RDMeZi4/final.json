  "target_idea": "Propose a sampling-based energy function and scalable GNN layers that iteratively reduce it, with convergence guarantees in certain settings, and develop a full GNN architecture based on these designs.",
  "context": "Graph neural network (GNN) architectures are used to model data with cross-instance relations, often involving layers that iteratively reduce a graph-regularized energy function. These node embeddings serve as predictive features for tasks like node classification and as energy function minimizers, offering interpretability and inductive biases. However, scaling such GNN architectures is challenging due to the potential depth required for convergence during the forward pass.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid GNN architecture that incorporates an adaptive pruning mechanism to dynamically remove nodes and edges deemed irrelevant for specific tasks during training. This scalable approach would use reinforcement learning to decide which components of the graph contribute least to loss reduction, optimizing both the network's depth and breadth per iteration. This method combines the benefits of interpretability and efficiency, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining or enhancing model performance on tasks like node classification.",
  "final_idea": "Create a GNN architecture that incorporates a spectral clustering-based regularization technique to enforce sparsity in the connectivity matrix, thereby reducing the effective depth and breadth of the network. This method would prioritize the most informative connections during the forward pass, optimizing computational resources.",
