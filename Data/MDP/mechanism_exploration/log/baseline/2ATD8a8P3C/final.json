  "target_idea": "Propose a general framework for conformal prediction in structured prediction settings, modifying existing algorithms to output structured prediction sets that implicitly represent sets of labels. This approach can be applied in domains where prediction sets are represented as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, such as hierarchical labels in image classification.",
  "context": "Conformal prediction is a strategy for quantifying the uncertainty of predictive models by modifying them to output sets of labels that are likely to contain the true label. Existing algorithms have focused on classification and regression, where prediction sets are simple and easy to interpret. However, for complex structured outputs like text generation, these sets can become large and difficult to interpret.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hierarchical conformal prediction framework for structured output tasks like text generation, where the prediction sets are constructed at multiple granularity levels. Initially, broader categories or themes could be predicted (e.g., sentiment, topic) ensuring high coverage with less complexity, and then refined at subsequent levels to generate more specific phrases or sentences within those categories. This layered approach can help manage the interpretability and size of prediction sets by condensing the possible outputs at each stage based on prior conformal confidence levels.",
  "final_idea": "Apply graph-based techniques to structure the prediction sets in the hierarchical conformal prediction framework, where nodes represent potential outputs and edges indicate confidence levels. This visual approach could aid in better understanding the relationships and transitions between different levels of predictions.",
