  "target_idea": "Propose a fully model-based algorithm that utilizes object-centric mapping with hierarchical state and temporal abstraction, simplifying transition dynamics. This approach involves learning a discriminative world model, planning with a count-based intrinsic reward, and enabling efficient exploration and planning to reach discovered abstract states.",
  "context": "Reinforcement learning often faces challenges with difficult exploration problems, where agents struggle to efficiently learn and predict future states. Traditional methods may not effectively handle the complexity of state and action spaces, leading to inefficient learning processes.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid reinforcement learning model that integrates episodic memory with generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enhance exploration efficiency. The model will use episodic memory to recall and reinforce successful strategies from past experiences, while the GAN component generates novel, challenging scenarios mimicking potential future states and actions. This approach aims to simultaneously refine policy performance and expand the agent's experience horizon more adaptively and effectively than traditional exploration methods.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a reinforcement learning model that employs a hierarchical approach to decision-making, segmenting tasks into sub-goals. This method could facilitate more strategic exploration and efficient learning by reducing the complexity of the decision space at each level.",
