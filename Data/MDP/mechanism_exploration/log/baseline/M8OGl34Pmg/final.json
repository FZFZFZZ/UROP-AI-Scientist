  "target_idea": "Introduce the Social Dynamics Adaptation model (SDA), which uses a two-stage Reinforcement Learning framework. The first stage encodes human trajectories into social dynamics and learns a motion policy based on this information, while the second stage allows the model to infer social dynamics from the history of previous actions and statuses without direct trajectory access.",
  "context": "In shared environments, successful collaboration between humans and robots depends on the robot's ability to adapt in real-time to human motion. In Social Navigation, robots must maintain proximity to assist humans while avoiding collisions, which requires understanding human trajectories. However, these trajectories are only partially observable from the robot's perspective and are complex to process computationally.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a predictive model using a hybrid approach that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with probabilistic motion models. This model learns from dynamic social maps created from continuous sensor inputs, allowing the robot to anticipate changes in human movement patterns by understanding the relational dependencies between multiple moving entities in real-time. Additionally, incorporate adaptive reinforcement learning algorithms to continuously refine predictions based on changing environmental conditions and human behaviors, thus optimizing the robot's path planning and interaction strategies in complex, shared spaces.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a hierarchical predictive model that first identifies potential human motion patterns at a macro level using clustering algorithms, and then refines these predictions at a micro level using graph neural networks. This layered approach allows for handling complex social interactions and improves adaptability by focusing computational resources where needed.",
