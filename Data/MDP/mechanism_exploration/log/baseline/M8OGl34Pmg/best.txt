Best idea:
Implement a hierarchical predictive model that first identifies potential human motion patterns at a macro level using clustering algorithms, and then refines these predictions at a micro level using graph neural networks. This layered approach allows for handling complex social interactions and improves adaptability by focusing computational resources where needed.
