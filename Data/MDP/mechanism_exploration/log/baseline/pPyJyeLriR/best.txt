Best idea:
Develop a Multi-Layer Graph Unlearning Framework that utilizes a tiered approach, where the first layer employs fast approximate stochastic methods for initial unlearning, and subsequent layers apply increasingly precise deterministic methods as needed for certification, optimizing both speed and accuracy.
