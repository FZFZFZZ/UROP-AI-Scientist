  "target_idea": "Introduce ScaleGUN, a method that scales certified graph unlearning to billion-edge graphs by integrating approximate graph propagation techniques while maintaining certified guarantees for node feature, edge, and node unlearning scenarios.",
  "context": "Graph unlearning is crucial for privacy protection in applications using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with sensitive data. Certified graph unlearning offers strong privacy guarantees but is inefficient for large-scale graphs due to the need for costly re-computation of graph propagation for each unlearning request. While scalable techniques exist to speed up graph propagation, they introduce approximation errors, which conflict with the exact node embeddings required for certified guarantees.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a Dynamic Subgraph Masking technique for scalable graph unlearning in GNNs, where only subgraphs directly influenced by the data to be forgotten are identified and isolated dynamically. This requires a novel indexing mechanism that tracks dependency chains within a graph's nodes and edges, and a fast recomputation protocol that reruns graph propagation only within these affected subgraphs. This approach will isolate revisions to smaller, manageable sections of the graph, thus preserving the integrity of unaffected node embeddings and reducing the overall computational overhead, balancing both efficiency and certified unlearning accuracy.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a Multi-Layer Graph Unlearning Framework that utilizes a tiered approach, where the first layer employs fast approximate stochastic methods for initial unlearning, and subsequent layers apply increasingly precise deterministic methods as needed for certification, optimizing both speed and accuracy.",
