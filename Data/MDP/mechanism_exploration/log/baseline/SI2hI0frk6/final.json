  "target_idea": "Introduce Transfusion, a method that combines language modeling loss with diffusion to train a single transformer on mixed-modality sequences, incorporating modality-specific encoding and decoding layers to enhance performance and scalability.",
  "context": "Training multi-modal models over both discrete and continuous data presents challenges, particularly in effectively combining text and image data. Traditional approaches often involve quantizing images and training language models over discrete image tokens, which can be inefficient and limit scalability.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid generative adversarial network (GAN) that leverages continuous latent space representations for both image and text data. This network would use a shared latent space to promote the learning of a unified representation, facilitating direct interaction between the modalities. The discriminator's task would be to distinguish between real and generated samples while also verifying the alignment and coherence between the text and image content, effectively enhancing the model's ability to generate and interpret complex multi-modal data.",
  "final_idea": "Introduce a hybrid encoder architecture that uses separate branches for processing text and image data, then merges these representations using a fusion layer optimized through attention mechanisms. This structure could enhance the model's ability to learn from both modalities without the need for quantizing images into discrete tokens.",
