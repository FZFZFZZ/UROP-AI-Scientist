Best idea:
Develop a multimodal, multi-task learning architecture that integrates disparate weather data types (such as satellite imagery, radar data, atmospheric sensor readings, and social media feeds) to predict a variety of weather impacts simultaneously. This system would use a combination of convolutional neural networks for image processing, recurrent neural networks for time series prediction, and transformers to handle high variability tasks like social media sentiment analysis regarding weather perception. It would employ transfer learning to leverage large datasets from various geographic regions and seasons, enhancing its ability to generalize and perform accurately across different weather scenarios globally.
