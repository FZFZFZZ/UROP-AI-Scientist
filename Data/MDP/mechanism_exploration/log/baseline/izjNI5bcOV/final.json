  "target_idea": "Introduce the WeatherGFM, a generalist foundation model for weather understanding tasks, which unifies the representation and definition of diverse tasks. It employs weather prompt formats to manage different data modalities and uses a visual prompting question-answering paradigm for training, enabling it to handle multiple tasks in a unified manner.",
  "context": "The Earth's weather system is complex, involving various data modalities and tasks that are crucial for human life. Current data-driven models typically focus on individual weather understanding tasks, such as weather forecasting, but struggle to address multiple complex tasks within a single model. Additionally, these models are limited by their reliance on a small set of real observations for specific scenarios, which restricts their performance potential.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a multimodal, multi-task learning architecture that integrates disparate weather data types (such as satellite imagery, radar data, atmospheric sensor readings, and social media feeds) to predict a variety of weather impacts simultaneously. This system would use a combination of convolutional neural networks for image processing, recurrent neural networks for time series prediction, and transformers to handle high variability tasks like social media sentiment analysis regarding weather perception. It would employ transfer learning to leverage large datasets from various geographic regions and seasons, enhancing its ability to generalize and perform accurately across different weather scenarios globally.",
