  "target_idea": "Propose the Imposing Consistent Light (IC-Light) transport method during training, which leverages the physical principle of consistent linear blending of appearances under different illumination conditions to ensure stable and scalable illumination learning, allowing for uniform handling of diverse data sources and maintaining intrinsic image properties while modifying illumination.",
  "context": "Diffusion-based image generators are increasingly used for illumination harmonization and editing, but face challenges in scaling up training due to difficulties in preserving image details and maintaining intrinsic properties like albedos. Without proper constraints, training with complex or varied data can lead to random image generation rather than precise illumination manipulation.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a multi-stage diffusion-based image generator architecture where the first stage focuses exclusively on learning intrinsic image properties such as albedo, normal maps, and depth fields, using a self-supervised learning framework from unlabeled images. The second stage could then use these learned properties as conditioning inputs, applying learned variances specifically for the task of illumination manipulation, ensuring that lighting adjustments are physically plausible and consistent across diverse set of inputs. This approach allows the model to retain high fidelity in detail while effectively scaling up with increased training data variety without losing focus on the specific task of accurate illumination harmonization.",
  "final_idea": "Enhance the diffusion model's capability by integrating a physics-based simulation of light transport in the training process, which could guide the learning of illumination manipulation in a way that respects physical laws and enhances realism, particularly in complex lighting environments.",
