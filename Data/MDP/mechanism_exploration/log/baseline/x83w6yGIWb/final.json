  "target_idea": "Develop a self-generating calibration data synthesis strategy to construct feasible calibration data, which is crucial for effective post-training pruning, especially at high sparsity levels. This strategy focuses on using a small amount of data that is similar to the pre-training data to enhance the performance of strong pruning methods.",
  "context": "As large language models are increasingly used across various fields, there is a growing need for model compression to reduce costs and improve inference efficiency. Post-training pruning is a promising method for this purpose, as it does not require resource-intensive iterative training and only needs a small amount of calibration data to evaluate parameter importance. However, the effects of calibration data on post-training pruning have not been systematically explored, and it is unclear if better calibration data construction strategies exist.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a meta-learning algorithm that automatically generates and optimizes calibration datasets for post-training pruning of language models based on their specific application domains and usage patterns. This algorithm would use transfer learning techniques to adapt knowledge from a broad range of models and tasks to predict the most impactful types of data for pruning efficacy. By refining calibration data in this targeted manner, the model would effectively learn to prune itself more efficiently under varied real-world conditions.",
  "final_idea": "Investigate the application of genetic algorithms to evolve calibration datasets over generations by selecting and recombining high-performing subsets of data, thus optimizing the dataset for better pruning outcomes without extensive domain knowledge.",
