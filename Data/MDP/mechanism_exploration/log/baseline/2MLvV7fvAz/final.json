  "target_idea": "Introduce Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (CUSP), a novel paradigm that integrates curvature (geometric) and spectral insights. CUSP is a mixed-curvature spectral GNN that optimizes node embeddings in products of constant curvature manifolds using three components: Cusp Laplacian for capturing curvature signals, Cusp Filtering for spectral cues, and Cusp Pooling for assessing substructure importance with curvature-based encoding.",
  "context": "Graph representation learning has been exploring the use of non-Euclidean geometries, such as Riemannian manifolds, to embed complex graph structures like scale-free, hierarchical, and cyclic patterns. Spectral filtering is known for its ability to process signal variations across graphs, making it effective in both homophilic and heterophilic settings. Combining these approaches could potentially enhance the quality of learned graph representations.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid graph representation model that incorporates spectral filters within non-Euclidean geometries, specifically using a dynamic tuning mechanism for spectral filters based on the curvature of Riemannian manifolds. This model dynamically adjusts the spectral filtering process according to the local geometric properties of the graph, identified through the manifold's metric tensor. The aim is to optimize representation learning based on the intrinsic geometric complexity of different parts of the graph, improving the discriminative power and robustness of embeddings for complex network structures such as multi-scale or irregularly interconnected systems.",
