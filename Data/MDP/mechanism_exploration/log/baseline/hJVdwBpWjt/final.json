  "target_idea": "Introduce NatureLM-audio, the first audio-language foundation model specifically designed for bioacoustics, trained on a curated dataset of text-audio pairs from bioacoustics, speech, and music to address data scarcity. The model successfully transfers learned representations from music and speech to bioacoustics, demonstrating promising generalization to unseen taxa and tasks.",
  "context": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various auditory tasks, such as speech, music, and general audio, but their potential in bioacoustics tasks remains underexplored. These tasks, which include detecting animal vocalizations, classifying rare species, and labeling context and behavior, are vital for conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and animal behavior studies. The field faces challenges due to the limited availability of annotated data.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a cross-modal transfer learning approach where LLMs trained extensively on human languages are fine-tuned for bioacoustics tasks, leveraging similarities in linguistic structures and auditory features between human speech and animal vocalizations. This methodology would use minimal labeled bioacoustics data by initially adapting the models to recognize and generalize the structural patterns of animal sounds based on the syntax and semantics learned from human languages. Such an approach could significantly enhance the model's ability to classify rare species and decode complex vocal behaviors with greater accuracy and fewer examples.",
