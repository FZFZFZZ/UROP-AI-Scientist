  "target_idea": "Propose a polarization technique for SSMs by setting two channels of the state transition matrices to zero and one, respectively, to address both recency bias and over-smoothing, enabling better associative recall accuracy and scalability with deeper architectures.",
  "context": "Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have been considered as alternatives to transformers, particularly for capturing long-sequence dependencies. However, they are limited by a strong recency bias, which affects their ability to recall distant information and introduces robustness issues. As SSMs are scaled deeper, they face a dilemma between recency bias and over-smoothing, where token representations become indistinguishable, hindering scalability.",
  "initial_idea": "Integrate adaptable gating mechanisms within Structured State Space Models to dynamically control the balance between recency influence and distant dependencies. This approach models the gating on a per-layer basis, where gates adjust their openness based on the variance and relevance of input features over time. Such mechanisms would allow SSMs to selectively enhance or suppress the influence of distant versus recent data points, potentially reducing the observed trade-off between recency bias and over-smoothing.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a dual-pathway Structured State Space Model, with one pathway focusing on recent information for immediate responsiveness and another on integrating distant information to provide context and depth, addressing the trade-off between recency bias and over-smoothing.",
