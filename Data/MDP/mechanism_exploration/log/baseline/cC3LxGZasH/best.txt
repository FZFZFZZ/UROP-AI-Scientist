Best idea:
Develop a hybrid evaluation metric that combines modified Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) with a neural predictive model. This hybrid metric would first transform video data into a modified I3D feature space optimized for approximating normal distribution through advanced normalization techniques. Subsequently, a trained recurrent neural network (RNN) would predict subsequent frames based on previous ones, and the prediction accuracy would be integrated into the FVD calculation, thus improving sensitivity to temporal distortions and reducing the need for large sample sizes.
