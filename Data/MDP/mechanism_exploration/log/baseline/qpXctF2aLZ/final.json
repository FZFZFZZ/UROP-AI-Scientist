  "target_idea": "Introduce SYMPOL, a novel method that integrates a tree-based model with a policy gradient method, allowing for the learning and adaptation of actions while maintaining interpretability. SYMPOL enables gradient-based, end-to-end learning of interpretable, axis-aligned decision trees within standard on-policy RL algorithms.",
  "context": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success in various domains, but its widespread adoption is hindered by the opaque nature of neural network policies, which are difficult to interpret. Symbolic policies, on the other hand, offer a compact and interpretable representation of decision-making strategies, yet learning these policies directly within on-policy methods poses challenges.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid reinforcement learning framework that utilizes a two-stage learning process combining neural and symbolic representations. In the initial stage, use a neural network to learn and approximate the optimal policy in a complex environment. In the second stage, employ a genetic programming approach to extract and refine interpretable, symbolic policies from the trained neural network's decisions, aligning symbolic decision trees or rules with the neural policyâ€™s actions, thus providing both performance efficiency and interpretability.",
  "final_idea": "Propose a reinforcement learning approach where the policy is represented as a set of logical rules derived from decision trees, which are then embedded into a neural network architecture to form a differentiable policy that can be fine-tuned using standard backpropagation techniques.",
