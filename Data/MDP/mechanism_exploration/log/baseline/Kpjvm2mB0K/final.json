  "target_idea": "Develop a streaming algorithm that constructs a sparse instance of the ℓp regression problem, approximating the cost with reduced space requirements. For p in [2, ∞], the algorithm uses space proportional to the number of columns, while for p in (1, 2), it adapts based on the H\"older conjugate exponent. Additionally, provide sublinear space upper bounds for outputting approximations of the solution, achieving efficient space usage for different values of p.",
  "context": "The study focuses on one-pass streaming algorithms for underdetermined ℓp linear regression problems, where the matrix A has more columns than rows, and the columns arrive in a stream. This problem generalizes basis pursuit and least squares solutions and is relevant in scenarios like edge insertion graph streams, capturing various flow problems on undirected graphs. The challenge is to design algorithms that use significantly less space than the entire data stream.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a one-pass streaming algorithm that leverages a randomized sketching technique combined with adaptive thresholding to selectively retain influential columns of the matrix A. The algorithm would utilize a dynamic quantile estimation scheme to adjust the importance threshold in real-time, based on the evolving norms of arriving columns. This approach minimizes memory usage by only storing columns that significantly alter the current solution landscape, potentially improving both the computational efficiency and accuracy of the solution in underdetermined ℓp regression problems.",
  "final_idea": "Implement an algorithm based on the concept of core-set construction, where a small, representative set of columns that approximates the entire stream's behavior is maintained. This core-set would be updated using a novel geometric merging strategy, aimed at preserving the most critical features of the regression problem with minimal space.",
