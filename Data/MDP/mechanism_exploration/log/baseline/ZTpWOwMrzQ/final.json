  "target_idea": "Propose Radar, a training-free method that enhances inference by dynamically identifying the most important context tokens, thereby reducing decoding time complexity for any pre-trained Transformer without additional training or heuristic token eviction.",
  "context": "Transformer models have shown outstanding performance in various applications. However, the dot-product attention mechanism, which is central to Transformer models, struggles with scalability for long-context data due to its quadratic time complexity with respect to context length.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that learns to selectively activate attention connections based on the hierarchical structure and relevance of input segments over time. This method would involve an auxiliary network that predicts the importance of each segment of data, allowing the main Transformer to focus its computational resources effectively on key segments, thus reducing computational complexity while preserving or even enhancing model performance on long sequences. This approach could also adapt dynamically to different data modalities and complexities, optimizing both efficiency and accuracy in processing extensive contexts.",
