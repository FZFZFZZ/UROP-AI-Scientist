Best idea:
Develop a hybrid document retrieval model that utilizes a dual-pathway architecture, where one pathway processes traditional free-form text through state-of-the-art language models, and the second pathway separately processes and gives weights to structured data fields such as titles, headers, and metadata. This model could use reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the weights and influence of each pathway based on retrieval success rates, optimizing the use of structured information to improve retrieval accuracy and relevance in real-time. This approach would allow the system to adaptively learn the importance of structured versus unstructured content elements based on their utility in specific query contexts.
