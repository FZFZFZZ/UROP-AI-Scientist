  "target_idea": "Introduce Multi-Field Adaptive Retrieval (mFAR), a framework that processes semi-structured data by decomposing documents into fields, indexing them independently using dense and lexical methods, and employing a model to adaptively predict field importance based on the document query for optimized retrieval.",
  "context": "Document retrieval tasks often deal with unstructured datasets, which consist of free-form text lacking explicit internal structure. However, documents can sometimes have a semi-structured format, containing fields like article titles, message bodies, or HTML headers, which are not fully utilized in traditional retrieval methods.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid document retrieval model that utilizes a dual-pathway architecture, where one pathway processes traditional free-form text through state-of-the-art language models, and the second pathway separately processes and gives weights to structured data fields such as titles, headers, and metadata. This model could use reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the weights and influence of each pathway based on retrieval success rates, optimizing the use of structured information to improve retrieval accuracy and relevance in real-time. This approach would allow the system to adaptively learn the importance of structured versus unstructured content elements based on their utility in specific query contexts.",
