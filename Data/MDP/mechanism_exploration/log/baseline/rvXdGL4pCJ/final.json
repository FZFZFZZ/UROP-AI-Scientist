  "target_idea": "Develop a methodology that robustifies an agent in the controlled environment and ensures a safe transfer to new environments, even when there are differences in safety-related dynamics.",
  "context": "Reinforcement learning (RL) often involves trial and error, which can lead to undesirable outcomes, making it unsuitable for safety-critical applications. Typically, a safe agent is trained in a controlled environment and then transferred to the real world, but differences in dynamics between these environments can lead to safety violations.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid reinforcement learning framework that integrates predictive risk assessment in its reward function to enhance safety. As an agent explores and learns from its environment, it simultaneously utilizes a pre-trained deep neural network model to predict potential risks based on current and historical state-actions. This model dynamically adjusts the reward penalties for actions predicted to have higher risk, thereby training the RL agent to avoid dangerous behaviors even in novel or changing conditions without previous direct negative outcomes.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a dual-phase training framework for RL agents where the first phase focuses on robust policy formation in a simulated environment using conservative exploration strategies, followed by a fine-tuning phase in the real environment under strict safety constraints.",
