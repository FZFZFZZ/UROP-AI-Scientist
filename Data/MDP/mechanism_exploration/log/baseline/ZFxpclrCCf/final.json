  "target_idea": "Propose a framework named Glad for generating video data in a frame-by-frame manner, ensuring temporal consistency through a latent variable propagation module that uses previous frame features as noise prior. Additionally, introduce a streaming data sampler to sample original images in a video clip continuously, allowing Glad to function as a streaming simulator for specific scenes.",
  "context": "In the field of autonomous driving, generating and simulating diverse real-world scenes is crucial, particularly for handling corner cases. Recent methods have utilized neural radiance fields or diffusion models to create novel views or synthetic data in driving scenarios. However, these methods face challenges with unseen scenes and limited video length, resulting in insufficient adaptability for data generation and simulation.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop an adaptive generative model that combines graph-based scene representation with conditional diffusion models to enhance the generation of dynamic, complex driving scenarios. The model would leverage a graph-based framework to articulate the spatial relationships and interactions between various objects in a scene (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights) and use this structure to guide the diffusion process in generating temporally coherent and contextually diverse scenes over extended periods. This approach would allow for the creation of longer, continuous video sequences by predictively modeling scene evolution based on both learned traffic patterns and new, improvised interactions, improving the system's ability to handle unseen corner cases.",
  "final_idea": "Enhance the temporal coherence of generated scenes by introducing a memory-augmented neural network architecture that can store and recall past driving scenarios, using this historical context to inform and stabilize the generation of future frames in extended sequences.",
