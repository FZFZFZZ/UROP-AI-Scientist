  "target_idea": "Develop a comprehensive benchmark called GlycanML for glycan property and function prediction, incorporating diverse tasks such as glycan taxonomy prediction and protein-glycan interaction prediction. GlycanML supports both sequence and graph representations, allowing evaluation of sequence-based models and graph neural networks. Additionally, introduce the GlycanML-MTL testbed for multi-task learning algorithms to explore the impact of taxonomy prediction on other function prediction tasks.",
  "context": "Glycans are fundamental biomolecules that play crucial roles in biological systems. The growing volume of functional glycan data presents an opportunity for machine learning to enhance glycan understanding. However, there is currently no standardized machine learning benchmark for predicting glycan properties and functions.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a \"GlycanAtlas\" platform, a centralized machine learning benchmark system specifically designed for predicting glycan properties and functions. This platform would aggregate glycan datasets from various sources, standardizing data preprocessing and feature extraction while employing a suite of AI algorithms tested against each dataset. By providing open access to this platform, researchers can contribute their datasets, test new algorithms, compare performance across different models, and thus collectively enhance the precision and applicability of glycan function predictions.",
