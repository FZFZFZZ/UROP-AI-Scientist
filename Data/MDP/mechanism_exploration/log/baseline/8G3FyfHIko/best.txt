Best idea:
Develop a dual-modal interactive system that combines point-based input with real-time verbal feedback for image manipulation. As the user selects points for manipulation, they can verbally specify their intentions ("remove object", "enhance color", "blur background"), which the system interprets using NLP techniques to reduce intention ambiguity. Simultaneously, the system employs an attention-driven AI model to analyze the context of the selected area and adjacent visual elements, dynamically adjusting its processing to mitigate content ambiguity and enhance the target manipulation results.
