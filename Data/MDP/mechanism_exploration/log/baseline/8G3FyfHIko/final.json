  "target_idea": "Propose a novel task-aware, training-free framework called GDrag, which defines a taxonomy of atomic manipulations to reduce intention ambiguity and introduces two strategies, ADT and SMS, to mitigate content ambiguity by modeling fine-grained target contexts and generating precise trajectories.",
  "context": "Recent interactive point-based image manipulation methods have become popular due to their user-friendly nature. However, these methods encounter two main types of ambiguity issues: intention ambiguity, which leads to misinterpretation of user purposes, and content ambiguity, where target image areas are distorted by distracting elements.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dual-modal interactive system that combines point-based input with real-time verbal feedback for image manipulation. As the user selects points for manipulation, they can verbally specify their intentions (\"remove object\", \"enhance color\", \"blur background\"), which the system interprets using NLP techniques to reduce intention ambiguity. Simultaneously, the system employs an attention-driven AI model to analyze the context of the selected area and adjacent visual elements, dynamically adjusting its processing to mitigate content ambiguity and enhance the target manipulation results.",
