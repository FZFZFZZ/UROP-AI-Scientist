  "target_idea": "Propose BRIDGE, an algorithm that alternates between an optimization step using Bayesian optimization to identify influential example sets and a generation step to expand reasoning paths, thereby enhancing many-shot in-context learning by leveraging these influential examples.",
  "context": "Recent developments in long-context large language models have introduced the many-shot in-context learning paradigm, which suggests that using a larger number of demonstrating examples can enhance performance compared to the traditional few-shot approach. However, it remains uncertain which factors primarily contribute to these benefits and whether merely increasing the number of examples is the most effective strategy for improving many-shot in-context learning.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic sampling algorithm that optimizes the selection of demonstration examples for many-shot in-context learning by analyzing the semantic diversity and relevance of the training samples in real-time. This tool would use unsupervised clustering techniques to categorize potential examples into diverse yet semantically similar groups, enabling the language model to dynamically choose the most representative and diverse set of examples for each new task. This approach ensures optimal learning by preventing overfitting on redundant examples and instead focusing on a breadth of informative contexts.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a Bayesian optimization technique to guide the selection of demonstration examples, focusing on maximizing a utility function that balances the trade-off between model confidence and example diversity. This method would iteratively improve the quality of selected examples based on probabilistic modeling of their effectiveness.",
