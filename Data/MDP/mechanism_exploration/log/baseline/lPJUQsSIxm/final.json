  "target_idea": "Introduce DCT-CryptoNets, a method that operates in the frequency-domain using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to alleviate the computational demands of non-linear activations and homomorphic bootstrap operations during private inference, enhancing efficiency and scalability for encrypted deep learning on high-resolution images.",
  "context": "The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) with machine learning presents opportunities for secure data processing, allowing computations on encrypted data while maintaining confidentiality. However, current FHE-based implementations for deep neural networks are hindered by high computational costs, latency, and scalability issues, which restrict their practical use.",
  "initial_idea": "Design a machine learning framework that dynamically adapts the precision of computations based on the complexity of the task and data sensitivity, specifically for FHE-enabled models. This framework will employ low-precision arithmetic for less sensitive tasks to reduce computational overhead, and switch to full precision only for highly sensitive operations. By adjusting the computational precision in real-time, this method will minimize the computational costs and latency commonly associated with FHE, thereby enhancing scalability and practical usability of secure deep learning models.",
  "final_idea": "Investigate the adaptation of existing fast-algorithm strategies from classical computing, such as FFT-based methods, to the encrypted domain to accelerate operations in neural networks, focusing on reducing the computational complexity inherent in FHE.",
