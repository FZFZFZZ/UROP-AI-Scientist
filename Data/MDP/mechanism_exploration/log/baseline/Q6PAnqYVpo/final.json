  "target_idea": "Propose a novel algorithm that performs soft semantic pattern matching by integrating word embeddings to relax surface-level matching. This algorithm is scalable for large corpora using inverted indexes, and an efficient implementation is provided along with an accessible web tool.",
  "context": "In natural language processing and computational linguistics, researchers often analyze real language usage using large-scale corpora. Common tools like grep and keyword-in-context concordancers are employed for pattern matching, but they are limited to surface-level string matching, which fails to handle orthographic variations and paraphrasing. Additionally, continuous approaches like dense vector search can be too coarse, retrieving unrelated texts that merely share similar topics.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid search tool that combines rule-based phonetic algorithms with semantic neural embeddings to enhance pattern matching across different languages and dialects. This tool would employ adaptive phonetic matching, which can dynamically infer context-based phonetic variations, coupled with a layer of semantic understanding derived from transformer-based models that encode the depth of language use. By integrating these approaches, the tool can accurately identify and retrieve relevant text instances that account for complex paraphrasing, dialectal shifts, and subtle linguistic nuances, significantly improving the precision in linguistic research and corpus analysis.",
  "final_idea": "Develop a hybrid search framework that integrates rule-based pattern matching with neural embeddings, allowing the system to recognize both exact and paraphrased expressions. This framework could utilize a combination of regex-based methods for precise matches and transformer embeddings for capturing semantic nuances.",
