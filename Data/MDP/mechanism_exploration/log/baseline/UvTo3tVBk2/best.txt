Best idea:
Develop an augmented Linear Recurrent Neural Network model that integrates adaptive state-transition scaling. This model would use a trainable meta-layer that dynamically scales the diagonal elements of the state-transition matrix based on the contextual requirements of the sequence. By learning optimal scaling policies directly from data, the model can expand the effective value range of state transitions, enhancing its ability to manage complex state-tracking tasks like code evaluation.
