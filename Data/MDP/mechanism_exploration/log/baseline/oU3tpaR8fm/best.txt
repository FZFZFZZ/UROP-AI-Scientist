Best idea:
Employ a hybrid model combining retrieval-augmented generation with supervised learning techniques to train the model on distinguishing between 'useful' and 'hard negative' passages. This could involve using labeled datasets where the impact of different types of retrieved content on output quality is annotated, thus teaching the model to avoid less useful information.
