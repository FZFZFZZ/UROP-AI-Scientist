  "target_idea": "Propose both training-free and training-based approaches to mitigate the negative impact of 'hard negatives' in long-context LLM-based RAG. This includes retrieval reordering as a training-free optimization, and RAG-specific implicit LLM fine-tuning and RAG-oriented fine-tuning with intermediate reasoning as training-based methods, along with a systematic analysis of design choices for these methods.",
  "context": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows large language models (LLMs) to leverage external knowledge sources, with the potential to improve output quality by processing longer input sequences. It is assumed that a larger retrieval set would enhance performance by providing more relevant information. However, empirical findings show that for many long-context LLMs, the quality of generated output initially improves but then declines as the number of retrieved passages increases, due to the presence of 'hard negatives'.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic retrieval thresholding mechanism where the number of passages retrieved by a language model is adjusted in real-time based on the semantic coherence and relevance scores of the output during initial drafting phases. This approach uses a sliding scale of retrieval based on the evolving clarity and specificity of the user's query or the complexity of the topic being addressed. The model would initially retrieve a broader set of documents and then fine-tune the number and nature of these documents, aiming to optimize the balance between information breadth and depth while minimizing the inclusion of hard negatives.",
  "final_idea": "Employ a hybrid model combining retrieval-augmented generation with supervised learning techniques to train the model on distinguishing between 'useful' and 'hard negative' passages. This could involve using labeled datasets where the impact of different types of retrieved content on output quality is annotated, thus teaching the model to avoid less useful information.",
