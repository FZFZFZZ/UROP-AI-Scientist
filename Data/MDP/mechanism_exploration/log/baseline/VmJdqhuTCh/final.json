  "target_idea": "Propose FOurier transform compression with seLf-Knowledge distillation (FOLK), which adaptively selects masked-out frequencies based on image frequency responses and employs a two-branch framework with knowledge distillation to process both filtered and original images, reducing the burden on downstream tasks.",
  "context": "Previous frequency-based Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for pre-training involved masking out pre-defined frequencies in input images and using a reconstruction loss. These methods faced two main limitations: they did not account for the variability in image frequency responses, and models pre-trained with frequency-filtered images required more data to adapt to natural images during fine-tuning.",
  "initial_idea": "Introduce a dynamic frequency masking technique for SSL where the frequencies masked are determined by an auxiliary network trained to identify frequency bands that maximally confuse a classifier trained on unmasked images. This method adapts to the individual image characteristics and the variability in frequency responses by optimizing the auxiliary network to predict the most “informative” frequencies to mask, thus providing a more robust and less data-intensive model adaptation during fine-tuning. The auxiliary network's predictions can also provide insights into the frequency importance for different classes and tasks, enhancing model interpretability.",
