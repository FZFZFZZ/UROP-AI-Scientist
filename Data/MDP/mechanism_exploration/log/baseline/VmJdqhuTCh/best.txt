Introduce a dynamic frequency masking technique for SSL where the frequencies masked are determined by an auxiliary network trained to identify frequency bands that maximally confuse a classifier trained on unmasked images. This method adapts to the individual image characteristics and the variability in frequency responses by optimizing the auxiliary network to predict the most “informative” frequencies to mask, thus providing a more robust and less data-intensive model adaptation during fine-tuning. The auxiliary network's predictions can also provide insights into the frequency importance for different classes and tasks, enhancing model interpretability.
