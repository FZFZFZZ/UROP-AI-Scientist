Best idea:
Develop a meta-learning algorithm that utilizes a dynamic memory-augmentation approach, where the autonomous agent stores distinct experiences as modular memories. Each memory module can be selectively activated based on similarity to current challenges, allowing the agent to construct hybrid strategies that blend various pieces of prior knowledge for new problems. This system could adaptively reconfigure the interconnections between memory modules based on feedback from new experiences, optimizing knowledge reuse and accelerating skill acquisition in diverse domains.
