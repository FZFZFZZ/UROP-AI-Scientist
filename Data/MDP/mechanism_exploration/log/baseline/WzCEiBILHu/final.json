  "target_idea": "Introduce the Topological Schrödinger Bridge problem for matching signal distributions on topological domains by setting the reference process to follow topology-aware stochastic dynamics. Develop models that parameterize unknowns in the optimal process as topological neural networks, learning them through likelihood training.",
  "context": "The Schrödinger Bridge problem aims to find the most likely random evolution between two boundary distributions with respect to a reference process. While effective in Euclidean domains, existing methods struggle with topological domains like graphs and simplicial complexes, which are important for data over network entities such as node signals and edge flows.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a new algorithm for the Schrödinger Bridge problem tailored for topological domains by leveraging spectral graph theory. This algorithm would first transform graph-based topological data into the spectral domain using the Laplacian matrix, facilitating the application of Schrödinger Bridge methods by smoothing the complex topological structure into a form that's easier to handle numerically. By doing this, we could more efficiently approximate probabilistic evolutions between complex network states, potentially improving prediction and system modeling in domains like social networks or neural circuits.",
  "final_idea": "Propose a dual-network architecture where one network learns the optimal transport problem and another approximates the reference process, specifically designed for handling the Schrödinger Bridge problem in graph-based domains.",
