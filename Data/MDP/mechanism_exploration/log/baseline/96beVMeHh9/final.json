  "target_idea": "Propose a nonparametric causal identification framework inspired by the coarsened data framework, utilizing stochastic process theory, measure theory, and net convergence. This framework generalizes classical methods like g-computation, inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust formulas to handle time-varying outcomes in functional longitudinal data.",
  "context": "In modern medical research, real-time monitoring generates functional longitudinal data, which involves continuous-time measurements of outcomes, treatments, and confounders. This results in complex treatment-confounder feedback loops that traditional causal inference methods struggle to address.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic causal modeling framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning with Bayesian networks to analyze and untangle feedback loops in continuous-time medical data. This model would learn optimal intervention strategies by simulating various scenarios in silico, adapting to new data in real-time. The framework's success would depend on its ability to accurately model the underlying dynamics of the treatment-confounder relationships and predict how interventions might change these relationships over time.",
  "final_idea": "Implement an adaptive causal inference model utilizing Gaussian Process Dynamical Systems to capture the temporal evolution of variables in continuous-time medical data. This approach will allow for the modeling of non-linear dependencies and stochastic behaviors inherent in treatment-confounder interactions, enhancing prediction accuracy of intervention outcomes.",
