  "target_idea": "Introduce a theoretical foundation for the convergence rate of BT reward models using deep neural networks with embeddings, and propose an alternative order-consistent reward modeling objective using a simple upper-bound algorithm compatible with binary classifiers.",
  "context": "The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is widely used in reward modeling for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), despite its origins in multi-player stochastic game matching. The model's application in converting pairwise response comparisons to reward values and making predictions is not well understood, especially given the sparse comparison of prompt-response pairs.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a hybrid model that combines the Bradley-Terry model with deep reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the reward function for LLMs. This model would use the BT model to handle sparse pairwise comparisons while leveraging reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust reward predictions based on aggregated real-time feedback from LLM interactions. The system could progressively refine its understanding of reward values, thus enhancing the alignment of LLM responses with human values and context-specific nuances.",
