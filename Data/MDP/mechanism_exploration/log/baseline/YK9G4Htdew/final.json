  "target_idea": "Introduce TWISTER, a Transformer-based world model that extends predictions to longer time horizons using action-conditioned Contrastive Predictive Coding, enhancing the learning of high-level temporal feature representations to improve agent performance.",
  "context": "The DreamerV3 algorithm has shown exceptional performance in various environments by utilizing a world model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Despite the success of model-based reinforcement learning and the adoption of Transformer architectures for their training efficiency, attempts to replace RNN-based models with Transformer-based models, such as in the STORM approach, have not significantly improved performance. These methods have struggled to develop competitive Transformer-based world models.",
  "initial_idea": "Introduce a hybrid model that combines the temporal continuity strengths of RNNs with the attention mechanisms of Transformers to advance world modeling in reinforcement learning. Specifically, design a layered approach where an RNN processes sequences to capture dynamic temporal dependencies, over which a Transformer-based model overlays to refine predictions and integrate wider contextual information more effectively. This dual-model setup can be trained end-to-end to dynamically focus on relevant sequence features while maintaining efficient handling of longer-range dependencies, potentially resolving the limitations encountered with pure Transformer-based approaches in complex, variable environments.",
  "final_idea": "Utilize a contrastive loss function in the training of Transformer-based models to better differentiate between similar but distinct environmental states, which could lead to more precise state representations and improved policy decisions.",
