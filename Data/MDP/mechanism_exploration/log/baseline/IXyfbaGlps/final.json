  "target_idea": "Introduce a lifting layer in GCNNs to transform input images directly, resolving the issue of invalid RGB values and significantly improving equivariance error. Extend color equivariance to include saturation and luminance shifts, enhancing generalization to perceptual variations and sample efficiency.",
  "context": "Group convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have been developed to handle various geometric transformations, including rotations and scaling, and have shown improved interpretability, accuracy, and generalizability. However, their application in perceptual quantities, such as color variations, has been limited. The CEConv network attempted to address hue transformations using GCNNs but faced issues with invalid RGB values, which compromised performance and equivariance.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a color-equivariant GCNN that uses a perceptual color space transformation layer to preprocess input images, converting RGB values into a color representation more invariant to variations in luminance and saturation (such as CIELAB or HSV). This transformed input can then be processed by the group convolutional layers designed to maintain the geometric transformations' equivariance while also adapting to shifts in hue and chroma. To tackle the issue of invalid RGB values post-transformation, introduce an autoencoder-like mechanism within the network that learns to project back any out-of-gamut colors into a valid RGB space, ensuring both high fidelity color reproduction and adherence to geometric transformations.",
