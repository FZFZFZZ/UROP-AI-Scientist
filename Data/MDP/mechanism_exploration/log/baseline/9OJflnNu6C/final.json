  "target_idea": "Propose a controllable unlearning framework for I2I generative models using a control coefficient to manage the trade-off between unlearning and utility. Reformulate the unlearning problem into a constrained optimization problem, solved with a gradient-based method to achieve Pareto optimal solutions within defined boundaries for the control coefficient.",
  "context": "Generative models have advanced significantly but pose issues like privacy breaches and biases. Machine unlearning has been proposed to address these concerns by removing specific training data from models. In the context of Image-to-Image (I2I) generative models, previous approaches have treated unlearning as a single objective optimization problem, which does not account for diverse user expectations regarding the balance between unlearning and model utility.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a multi-objective optimization framework for machine unlearning in I2I generative models that allows users to dynamically adjust the trade-off between unlearning effectiveness and model performance. This framework could utilize a Pareto efficiency approach, where various Pareto optimal solutions are generated and users can select a solution based on their specific requirements. This method would not only improve privacy and bias mitigation but also maintain model utility tailored to different user needs or applications.",
