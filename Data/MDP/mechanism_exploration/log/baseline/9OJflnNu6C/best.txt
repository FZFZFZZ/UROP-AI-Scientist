Best idea:
Develop a multi-objective optimization framework for machine unlearning in I2I generative models that allows users to dynamically adjust the trade-off between unlearning effectiveness and model performance. This framework could utilize a Pareto efficiency approach, where various Pareto optimal solutions are generated and users can select a solution based on their specific requirements. This method would not only improve privacy and bias mitigation but also maintain model utility tailored to different user needs or applications.
