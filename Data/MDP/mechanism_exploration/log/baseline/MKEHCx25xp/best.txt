Best score: 0.78
Best idea:
Implement a multi-model comparative evaluation system where LLMs are assessed against several baseline models, not just one. This system would include statistical methods to normalize scores across different models and control for variability in response quality due to length bias and other factors, enhancing the robustness of the evaluation results.
