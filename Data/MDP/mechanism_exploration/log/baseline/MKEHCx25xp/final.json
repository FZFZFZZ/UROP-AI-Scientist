  "target_idea": "Introduce WildBench, an automated evaluation framework that benchmarks LLMs using 1,024 tasks from human-chatbot conversation logs. It employs two metrics, WB-Reward and WB-Score, for systematic evaluation with task-specific checklists and structured explanations. WB-Reward uses fine-grained pairwise comparisons with multiple baseline models, while WB-Score provides a fast, cost-efficient individual output evaluation, incorporating a method to mitigate length bias.",
  "context": "Evaluating large language models (LLMs) using real-world user queries is challenging due to the complexity and variability of human-chatbot interactions. Traditional evaluation methods often rely on a single baseline model and may not adequately address issues such as length bias in model responses, leading to less reliable and interpretable results.",
  "initial_idea": "Develop a dynamic evaluation framework that incorporates a continuously updating corpus of anonymized, real-world user queries across various domains to test LLMs. This framework would use machine learning techniques to automatically categorize queries by complexity, intent, and subject matter, adjusting the difficulty and diversity of evaluation metrics accordingly. Additionally, it could employ statistical analysis to identify and compensate for biases, including length bias, in LLM responses, thereby providing a more accurate measurement of a modelâ€™s real-world performance and adaptability.",
  "final_idea": "Implement a multi-model comparative evaluation system where LLMs are assessed against several baseline models, not just one. This system would include statistical methods to normalize scores across different models and control for variability in response quality due to length bias and other factors, enhancing the robustness of the evaluation results.",
