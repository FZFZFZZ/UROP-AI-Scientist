{"uid":"p_alphaedit","problem":"Deep learning models for tabular data have yet to consistently outperform gradient-boosted decision trees, and existing retrieval-augmented approaches for tabular DL are often complex and inefficient.","idea":"Develop a feed-forward neural network architecture incorporating a custom k-Nearest-Neighbors-inspired retrieval component with an attention-like mechanism to efficiently leverage information from similar training instances for improved tabular data modeling."}
